///////////////////////////  DRIVER CAPABILITIES  ////////////////////////////
  The Cg compiler uses different "profiles" with different capabilities.
  This shader requires a Cg compilation profile >= arbfp1, but a few options
  require higher profiles like fp30 or fp40.  The shader can't detect profile
  or driver capabilities, so instead you must comment or uncomment the lines
  below with "//" before "#define."  Disable an option if you get compilation
  errors resembling those listed.  Generally speaking, all of these options
  will run on nVidia cards, but only DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DBIAS (if that) is
  likely to run on ATI/AMD, due to the Cg compiler's profile limitations.
  Derivatives: Unsupported on fp20, ps_1_1, ps_1_2, ps_1_3, and arbfp1.
  Among other things, derivatives help us fix anisotropic filtering artifacts
  with curved manually tiled phosphor mask coords.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float2 ddx(float2);" not supported in this profile
  error C3004: function "float2 ddy(float2);" not supported in this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_DERIVATIVES
  Fine derivatives: Unsupported on older ATI cards.
  Fine derivatives enable 2x2 fragment block communication, letting us perform
  fast single-pass blur operations.  If your card uses coarse derivatives and
  these are enabled, blurs could look broken.  Derivatives are a prerequisite.
  Dynamic looping: Requires an fp30 or newer profile.
  This makes phosphor mask resampling faster in some cases.  Related errors:
  error C5013: profile does not support "for" statements and "for" could not
  be unrolled
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_BRANCHES
  Without DRIVERS_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_BRANCHES, we need to use unrollable loops.
  Using one static loop avoids overhead if the user is right, but if the user
  is wrong (loops are allowed), breaking a loop into if-blocked pieces with a
  binary search can potentially save some iterations.  However, it may fail:
  error C6001: Temporary register limit of 32 exceeded; 35 registers
  needed to compile program
#define ACCOMODATE_POSSIBLE_DYNAMIC_LOOPS
  tex2Dlod: Requires an fp40 or newer profile.  This can be used to disable
  anisotropic filtering, thereby fixing related artifacts.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float4 tex2Dlod(sampler2D, float4);" not supported in
  this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DLOD
  tex2Dbias: Requires an fp30 or newer profile.  This can be used to alleviate
  artifacts from anisotropic filtering and mipmapping.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float4 tex2Dbias(sampler2D, float4);" not supported
  in this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DBIAS
  Integrated graphics compatibility: Integrated graphics like Intel HD 4000
  impose stricter limitations on register counts and instructions.  Enable
  INTEGRATED_GRAPHICS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE if you still see error C6001 or:
  error C6002: Instruction limit of 1024 exceeded: 1523 instructions needed
  to compile program.
  Enabling integrated graphics compatibility mode will automatically disable:
  1.) PHOSPHOR_MASK_MANUALLY_RESIZE: The phosphor mask will be softer.
      (This may be reenabled in a later release.)
  2.) RUNTIME_GEOMETRY_MODE
  3.) The high-quality 4x4 Gaussian resize for the bloom approximation

  RUNTIME VS. COMPILE-TIME OPTIONS (Major Performance Implications):
  Enable runtime shader parameters in the Retroarch (etc.) GUI?  They override
  many of the options in this file and allow real-time tuning, but many of
  them are slower.  Disabling them and using this text file will boost FPS.
  Specify the phosphor bloom sigma at runtime?  This option is 10% slower, but
  it's the only way to do a wide-enough full bloom with a runtime dot pitch.
  Specify antialiasing weight parameters at runtime?  (Costs ~20% with cubics)
  Specify subpixel offsets at runtime? (WARNING: EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE!)
#define RUNTIME_ANTIALIAS_SUBPIXEL_OFFSETS
  Make beam_horiz_filter and beam_horiz_linear_rgb_weight into runtime shader
  parameters?  This will require more math or dynamic branching.
  Specify the tilt at runtime?  This makes things about 3% slower.
  Specify the geometry mode at runtime?
  Specify the phosphor mask type (aperture grille, slot mask, shadow mask) and
  mode (Lanczos-resize, hardware resize, or tile 1:1) at runtime, even without
  dynamic branches?  This is cheap if mask_resize_viewport_scale is small.
  PHOSPHOR MASK:
  Manually resize the phosphor mask for best results (slower)?  Disabling this
  removes the option to do so, but it may be faster without dynamic branches.
  If we sinc-resize the mask, should we Lanczos-window it (slower but better)?
  Larger blurs are expensive, but we need them to blur larger triads.  We can
  detect the right blur if the triad size is static or our profile allows
  dynamic branches, but otherwise we use the largest blur the user indicates
  they might need:
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_6_PIXELS
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_9_PIXELS
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_12_PIXELS

/////////////////////////////  USER PARAMETERS  //////////////////////////////
  Note: Many of these static parameters are overridden by runtime shader
  parameters when those are enabled.  However, many others are static codepath
  options that were cleaner or more convert to code as static constants.
  GAMMA:
  LEVELS MANAGEMENT:
  Control the final multiplicative image contrast:
  We auto-dim to avoid clipping between passes and restore brightness
  later.  Control the dim factor here: Lower values clip less but crush
  blacks more (static only for now).
  HALATION/DIFFUSION/BLOOM:
  Halation weight: How much energy should be lost to electrons bounding
  around under the CRT glass and exciting random phosphors?
  Refractive diffusion weight: How much light should spread/diffuse from
  refracting through the CRT glass?
  Underestimate brightness: Bright areas bloom more, but we can base the
  bloom brightpass on a lower brightness to sharpen phosphors, or a higher
  brightness to soften them.  Low values clip, but >= 0.8 looks okay.
  Blur all colors more than necessary for a softer phosphor bloom?
  The BLOOM_APPROX pass approximates a phosphor blur early on with a small
  blurred resize of the input (convergence offsets are applied as well).
  There are three filter options (static option only for now):
  0.) Bilinear resize: A fast, close approximation to a 4x4 resize
      if min_allowed_viewport_triads and the BLOOM_APPROX resolution are sane
      and beam_max_sigma is low.
  1.) 3x3 resize blur: Medium speed, soft/smeared from bilinear blurring,
      always uses a static sigma regardless of beam_max_sigma or
      mask_num_triads_desired.
  2.) True 4x4 Gaussian resize: Slowest, technically correct.
  These options are more pronounced for the fast, unbloomed shader version.
  ELECTRON BEAM SCANLINE DISTRIBUTION:
  How many scanlines should contribute light to each pixel?  Using more
  scanlines is slower (especially for a generalized Gaussian) but less
  distorted with larger beam sigmas (especially for a pure Gaussian).  The
  max_beam_sigma at which the closest unused weight is guaranteed <
  1.0/255.0 (for a 3x antialiased pure Gaussian) is:
      2 scanlines: max_beam_sigma = 0.2089; distortions begin ~0.34; 141.7 FPS pure, 131.9 FPS generalized
      3 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.3879; distortions begin ~0.52; 137.5 FPS pure; 123.8 FPS generalized
      4 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.5723; distortions begin ~0.70; 134.7 FPS pure; 117.2 FPS generalized
      5 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.7591; distortions begin ~0.89; 131.6 FPS pure; 112.1 FPS generalized
      6 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.9483; distortions begin ~1.08; 127.9 FPS pure; 105.6 FPS generalized
  A generalized Gaussian beam varies shape with color too, now just width.
  It's slower but more flexible (static option only for now).
  What kind of scanline antialiasing do you want?
  0: Sample weights at 1x; 1: Sample weights at 3x; 2: Compute an integral
  Integrals are slow (especially for generalized Gaussians) and rarely any
  better than 3x antialiasing (static option only for now).
  Min/max standard deviations for scanline beams: Higher values widen and
  soften scanlines.  Depending on other options, low min sigmas can alias.
  Beam width varies as a function of color: A power function (0) is more
  configurable, but a spherical function (1) gives the widest beam
  variability without aliasing (static option only for now).
  Spot shape power: Powers <= 1 give smoother spot shapes but lower
  sharpness.  Powers >= 1.0 are awful unless mix/max sigmas are close.
  Generalized Gaussian max shape parameters: Higher values give flatter
  scanline plateaus and steeper dropoffs, simultaneously widening and
  sharpening scanlines at the cost of aliasing.  2.0 is pure Gaussian, and
  values > ~40.0 cause artifacts with integrals.
  Generalized Gaussian shape power: Affects how quickly the distribution
  changes shape from Gaussian to steep/plateaued as color increases from 0
  to 1.0.  Higher powers appear softer for most colors, and lower powers
  appear sharper for most colors.
  What filter should be used to sample scanlines horizontally?
  0: Quilez (fast), 1: Gaussian (configurable), 2: Lanczos2 (sharp)
  Standard deviation for horizontal Gaussian resampling:
  Do horizontal scanline sampling in linear RGB (correct light mixing),
  gamma-encoded RGB (darker, hard spot shape, may better match bandwidth-
  limiting circuitry in some CRT's), or a weighted avg.?
  Simulate scanline misconvergence?  This needs 3x horizontal texture
  samples and 3x texture samples of BLOOM_APPROX and HALATION_BLUR in
  later passes (static option only for now).
  Convergence offsets in x/y directions for R/G/B scanline beams in units
  of scanlines.  Positive offsets go right/down; ranges [-2, 2]
  Detect interlacing (static option only for now)?
  Assume 1080-line sources are interlaced?
  For interlaced sources, assume TFF (top-field first) or BFF order?
  (Whether this matters depends on the nature of the interlaced input.)
  ANTIALIASING:
  What AA level do you want for curvature/overscan/subpixels?  Options:
  0x (none), 1x (sample subpixels), 4x, 5x, 6x, 7x, 8x, 12x, 16x, 20x, 24x
  (Static option only for now)
  What antialiasing filter do you want (static option only)?  Options:
  0: Box (separable), 1: Box (cylindrical),
  2: Tent (separable), 3: Tent (cylindrical),
  4: Gaussian (separable), 5: Gaussian (cylindrical),
  6: Cubic* (separable), 7: Cubic* (cylindrical, poor)
  8: Lanczos Sinc (separable), 9: Lanczos Jinc (cylindrical, poor)
      * = Especially slow with RUNTIME_ANTIALIAS_WEIGHTS
  Flip the sample grid on odd/even frames (static option only for now)?
  Use RGB subpixel offsets for antialiasing?  The pixel is at green, and
  the blue offset is the negative r offset; range [0, 0.5]
  Cubics: See http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/filter/#mitchell
  1.) "Keys cubics" with B = 1 - 2C are considered the highest quality.
  2.) C = 0.5 (default) is Catmull-Rom; higher C's apply sharpening.
  3.) C = 1.0/3.0 is the Mitchell-Netravali filter.
  4.) C = 0.0 is a soft spline filter.
  Standard deviation for Gaussian antialiasing: Try 0.5/aa_pixel_diameter.
  PHOSPHOR MASK:
  Mask type: 0 = aperture grille, 1 = slot mask, 2 = EDP shadow mask
  We can sample the mask three ways.  Pick 2/3 from: Pretty/Fast/Flexible.
  0.) Sinc-resize to the desired dot pitch manually (pretty/slow/flexible).
      This requires PHOSPHOR_MASK_MANUALLY_RESIZE to be #defined.
  1.) Hardware-resize to the desired dot pitch (ugly/fast/flexible).  This
      is halfway decent with LUT mipmapping but atrocious without it.
  2.) Tile it without resizing at a 1:1 texel:pixel ratio for flat coords
      (pretty/fast/inflexible).  Each input LUT has a fixed dot pitch.
      This mode reuses the same masks, so triads will be enormous unless
      you change the mask LUT filenames in your .cgp file.
  Prefer setting the triad size (0.0) or number on the screen (1.0)?
  If RUNTIME_PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_SIGMA isn't #defined, the specified triad size
  will always be used to calculate the full bloom sigma statically.
  Specify the phosphor triad size, in pixels.  Each tile (usually with 8
  triads) will be rounded to the nearest integer tile size and clamped to
  obey minimum size constraints (imposed to reduce downsize taps) and
  maximum size constraints (imposed to have a sane MASK_RESIZE FBO size).
  To increase the size limit, double the viewport-relative scales for the
  two MASK_RESIZE passes in crt-royale.cgp and user-cgp-contants.h.
      range [1, mask_texture_small_size/mask_triads_per_tile]
  If mask_specify_num_triads is 1.0/true, we'll go by this instead (the
  final size will be rounded and constrained as above); default 480.0
  How many lobes should the sinc/Lanczos resizer use?  More lobes require
  more samples and avoid moire a bit better, but some is unavoidable
  depending on the destination size (static option for now).
  The mask is resized using a variable number of taps in each dimension,
  but some Cg profiles always fetch a constant number of taps no matter
  what (no dynamic branching).  We can limit the maximum number of taps if
  we statically limit the minimum phosphor triad size.  Larger values are
  faster, but the limit IS enforced (static option only, forever);
      range [1, mask_texture_small_size/mask_triads_per_tile]
  TODO: Make this 1.0 and compensate with smarter sampling!
  GEOMETRY:
  Geometry mode:
  0: Off (default), 1: Spherical mapping (like cgwg's),
  2: Alt. spherical mapping (more bulbous), 3: Cylindrical/Trinitron
  Radius of curvature: Measured in units of your viewport's diagonal size.
  View dist is the distance from the player to their physical screen, in
  units of the viewport's diagonal size.  It controls the field of view.
  Tilt angle in radians (clockwise around up and right vectors):
  Aspect ratio: When the true viewport size is unknown, this value is used
  to help convert between the phosphor triad size and count, along with
  the mask_resize_viewport_scale constant from user-cgp-constants.h.  Set
  this equal to Retroarch's display aspect ratio (DAR) for best results;
  range [1, geom_max_aspect_ratio from user-cgp-constants.h];
  default (256/224)*(54/47) = 1.313069909 (see below)
  Before getting into overscan, here's some general aspect ratio info:
  - DAR = display aspect ratio = SAR * PAR; as in your Retroarch setting
  - SAR = storage aspect ratio = DAR / PAR; square pixel emulator frame AR
  - PAR = pixel aspect ratio   = DAR / SAR; holds regardless of cropping
  Geometry processing has to "undo" the screen-space 2D DAR to calculate
  3D view vectors, then reapplies the aspect ratio to the simulated CRT in
  uv-space.  To ensure the source SAR is intended for a ~4:3 DAR, either:
  a.) Enable Retroarch's "Crop Overscan
  b.) Readd horizontal padding: Set overscan to e.g. N*(1.0, 240.0/224.0)
  Real consoles use horizontal black padding in the signal, but emulators
  often crop this without cropping the vertical padding; a 256x224 [S]NES
  frame (8:7 SAR) is intended for a ~4:3 DAR, but a 256x240 frame is not.
  The correct [S]NES PAR is 54:47, found by blargg and NewRisingSun:
      http://board.zsnes.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=11928&start=50
      http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=24815#p24815
  For flat output, it's okay to set DAR = [existing] SAR * [correct] PAR
  without doing a. or b., but horizontal image borders will be tighter
  than vertical ones, messing up curvature and overscan.  Fixing the
  padding first corrects this.
  Overscan: Amount to "zoom in" before cropping.  You can zoom uniformly
  or adjust x/y independently to e.g. readd horizontal padding, as noted
  above: Values < 1.0 zoom out; range (0, inf)
  Compute a proper pixel-space to texture-space matrix even without ddx()/
  ddy()?  This is ~8.5% slower but improves antialiasing/subpixel filtering
  with strong curvature (static option only for now).
  BORDERS:
  Rounded border size in texture uv coords:
  Border darkness: Moderate values darken the border smoothly, and high
  values make the image very dark just inside the border:
  Border compression: High numbers compress border transitions, narrowing
  the dark border area.

  bloom brightpass on a lower brightness to sharpen phosphors, or a higher
  brightness to soften them.  Low values clip, but >= 0.8 looks okay.
  Blur all colors more than necessary for a softer phosphor bloom?
  The BLOOM_APPROX pass approximates a phosphor blur early on with a small
  blurred resize of the input (convergence offsets are applied as well).
  There are three filter options (static option only for now):
  0.) Bilinear resize: A fast, close approximation to a 4x4 resize
      if min_allowed_viewport_triads and the BLOOM_APPROX resolution are sane
      and beam_max_sigma is low.
  1.) 3x3 resize blur: Medium speed, soft/smeared from bilinear blurring,
      always uses a static sigma regardless of beam_max_sigma or
      mask_num_triads_desired.
  2.) True 4x4 Gaussian resize: Slowest, technically correct.
  These options are more pronounced for the fast, unbloomed shader version.
  ELECTRON BEAM SCANLINE DISTRIBUTION:
  How many scanlines should contribute light to each pixel?  Using more
  scanlines is slower (especially for a generalized Gaussian) but less
  distorted with larger beam sigmas (especially for a pure Gaussian).  The
  max_beam_sigma at which the closest unused weight is guaranteed <
  1.0/255.0 (for a 3x antialiased pure Gaussian) is:
      2 scanlines: max_beam_sigma = 0.2089; distortions begin ~0.34; 141.7 FPS pure, 131.9 FPS generalized
      3 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.3879; distortions begin ~0.52; 137.5 FPS pure; 123.8 FPS generalized
      4 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.5723; distortions begin ~0.70; 134.7 FPS pure; 117.2 FPS generalized
      5 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.7591; distortions begin ~0.89; 131.6 FPS pure; 112.1 FPS generalized
      6 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.9483; distortions begin ~1.08; 127.9 FPS pure; 105.6 FPS generalized
  A generalized Gaussian beam varies shape with color too, now just width.
  It's slower but more flexible (static option only for now).
  What kind of scanline antialiasing do you want?
  0: Sample weights at 1x; 1: Sample weights at 3x; 2: Compute an integral
  Integrals are slow (especially for generalized Gaussians) and rarely any
  better than 3x antialiasing (static option only for now).
  Min/max standard deviations for scanline beams: Higher values widen and
  soften scanlines.  Depending on other options, low min sigmas can alias.
  Beam width varies as a function of color: A power function (0) is more
  configurable, but a spherical function (1) gives the widest beam
  variability without aliasing (static option only for now).
  Spot shape power: Powers <= 1 give smoother spot shapes but lower
  sharpness.  Powers >= 1.0 are awful unless mix/max sigmas are close.
  Generalized Gaussian max shape parameters: Higher values give flatter
  scanline plateaus and steeper dropoffs, simultaneously widening and
  sharpening scanlines at the cost of aliasing.  2.0 is pure Gaussian, and
  values > ~40.0 cause artifacts with integrals.
  Generalized Gaussian shape power: Affects how quickly the distribution
  changes shape from Gaussian to steep/plateaued as color increases from 0
  to 1.0.  Higher powers appear softer for most colors, and lower powers
  appear sharper for most colors.
  What filter should be used to sample scanlines horizontally?
  0: Quilez (fast), 1: Gaussian (configurable), 2: Lanczos2 (sharp)
  Standard deviation for horizontal Gaussian resampling:
  Do horizontal scanline sampling in linear RGB (correct light mixing),
  gamma-encoded RGB (darker, hard spot shape, may better match bandwidth-
  limiting circuitry in some CRT's), or a weighted avg.?
  Simulate scanline misconvergence?  This needs 3x horizontal texture
  samples and 3x texture samples of BLOOM_APPROX and HALATION_BLUR in
  later passes (static option only for now).
  Convergence offsets in x/y directions for R/G/B scanline beams in units
  of scanlines.  Positive offsets go right/down; ranges [-2, 2]
  Detect interlacing (static option only for now)?
  Assume 1080-line sources are interlaced?
  For interlaced sources, assume TFF (top-field first) or BFF order?
  (Whether this matters depends on the nature of the interlaced input.)
  ANTIALIASING:
  What AA level do you want for curvature/overscan/subpixels?  Options:
  0x (none), 1x (sample subpixels), 4x, 5x, 6x, 7x, 8x, 12x, 16x, 20x, 24x
  (Static option only for now)
  What antialiasing filter do you want (static option only)?  Options:
  0: Box (separable), 1: Box (cylindrical),
  2: Tent (separable), 3: Tent (cylindrical),
  4: Gaussian (separable), 5: Gaussian (cylindrical),
  6: Cubic* (separable), 7: Cubic* (cylindrical, poor)
  8: Lanczos Sinc (separable), 9: Lanczos Jinc (cylindrical, poor)
      * = Especially slow with RUNTIME_ANTIALIAS_WEIGHTS
  Flip the sample grid on odd/even frames (static option only for now)?
  Use RGB subpixel offsets for antialiasing?  The pixel is at green, and
  the blue offset is the negative r offset; range [0, 0.5]
  Cubics: See http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/filter/#mitchell
  1.) "Keys cubics" with B = 1 - 2C are considered the highest quality.
  2.) C = 0.5 (default) is Catmull-Rom; higher C's apply sharpening.
  3.) C = 1.0/3.0 is the Mitchell-Netravali filter.
  4.) C = 0.0 is a soft spline filter.
  Standard deviation for Gaussian antialiasing: Try 0.5/aa_pixel_diameter.
  PHOSPHOR MASK:
  Mask type: 0 = aperture grille, 1 = slot mask, 2 = EDP shadow mask
  We can sample the mask three ways.  Pick 2/3 from: Pretty/Fast/Flexible.
  0.) Sinc-resize to the desired dot pitch manually (pretty/slow/flexible).
      This requires PHOSPHOR_MASK_MANUALLY_RESIZE to be #defined.
  1.) Hardware-resize to the desired dot pitch (ugly/fast/flexible).  This
      is halfway decent with LUT mipmapping but atrocious without it.
  2.) Tile it without resizing at a 1:1 texel:pixel ratio for flat coords
      (pretty/fast/inflexible).  Each input LUT has a fixed dot pitch.
      This mode reuses the same masks, so triads will be enormous unless
      you change the mask LUT filenames in your .cgp file.
  Prefer setting the triad size (0.0) or number on the screen (1.0)?
  If RUNTIME_PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_SIGMA isn't #defined, the specified triad size
  will always be used to calculate the full bloom sigma statically.
  Specify the phosphor triad size, in pixels.  Each tile (usually with 8
  triads) will be rounded to the nearest integer tile size and clamped to
  obey minimum size constraints (imposed to reduce downsize taps) and
  maximum size constraints (imposed to have a sane MASK_RESIZE FBO size).
  To increase the size limit, double the viewport-relative scales for the
  two MASK_RESIZE passes in crt-royale.cgp and user-cgp-contants.h.
      range [1, mask_texture_small_size/mask_triads_per_tile]
  If mask_specify_num_triads is 1.0/true, we'll go by this instead (the
  final size will be rounded and constrained as above); default 480.0
  How many lobes should the sinc/Lanczos resizer use?  More lobes require
  more samples and avoid moire a bit better, but some is unavoidable
  depending on the destination size (static option for now).
  The mask is resized using a variable number of taps in each dimension,
  but some Cg profiles always fetch a constant number of taps no matter
  what (no dynamic branching).  We can limit the maximum number of taps if
  we statically limit the minimum phosphor triad size.  Larger values are
  faster, but the limit IS enforced (static option only, forever);
      range [1, mask_texture_small_size/mask_triads_per_tile]
  TODO: Make this 1.0 and compensate with smarter sampling!
  GEOMETRY:
  Geometry mode:
  0: Off (default), 1: Spherical mapping (like cgwg's),
  2: Alt. spherical mapping (more bulbous), 3: Cylindrical/Trinitron
  Radius of curvature: Measured in units of your viewport's diagonal size.
  View dist is the distance from the player to their physical screen, in
  units of the viewport's diagonal size.  It controls the field of view.
  Tilt angle in radians (clockwise around up and right vectors):
  Aspect ratio: When the true viewport size is unknown, this value is used
  to help convert between the phosphor triad size and count, along with
  the mask_resize_viewport_scale constant from user-cgp-constants.h.  Set
  this equal to Retroarch's display aspect ratio (DAR) for best results;
  range [1, geom_max_aspect_ratio from user-cgp-constants.h];
  default (256/224)*(54/47) = 1.313069909 (see below)
  Before getting into overscan, here's some general aspect ratio info:
  - DAR = display aspect ratio = SAR * PAR; as in your Retroarch setting
  - SAR = storage aspect ratio = DAR / PAR; square pixel emulator frame AR
  - PAR = pixel aspect ratio   = DAR / SAR; holds regardless of cropping
  Geometry processing has to "undo" the screen-space 2D DAR to calculate
  3D view vectors, then reapplies the aspect ratio to the simulated CRT in
  uv-space.  To ensure the source SAR is intended for a ~4:3 DAR, either:
  a.) Enable Retroarch's "Crop Overscan
  b.) Readd horizontal padding: Set overscan to e.g. N*(1.0, 240.0/224.0)
  Real consoles use horizontal black padding in the signal, but emulators
  often crop this without cropping the vertical padding; a 256x224 [S]NES
  frame (8:7 SAR) is intended for a ~4:3 DAR, but a 256x240 frame is not.
  The correct [S]NES PAR is 54:47, found by blargg and NewRisingSun:
      http://board.zsnes.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=11928&start=50
      http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=24815#p24815
  For flat output, it's okay to set DAR = [existing] SAR * [correct] PAR
  without doing a. or b., but horizontal image borders will be tighter
  than vertical ones, messing up curvature and overscan.  Fixing the
  padding first corrects this.
  Overscan: Amount to "zoom in" before cropping.  You can zoom uniformly
  or adjust x/y independently to e.g. readd horizontal padding, as noted
  above: Values < 1.0 zoom out; range (0, inf)
  Compute a proper pixel-space to texture-space matrix even without ddx()/
  ddy()?  This is ~8.5% slower but improves antialiasing/subpixel filtering
  with strong curvature (static option only for now).
  BORDERS:
  Rounded border size in texture uv coords:
  Border darkness: Moderate values darken the border smoothly, and high
  values make the image very dark just inside the border:
  Border compression: High numbers compress border transitions, narrowing
  the dark border area.
  IMPORTANT:
  These constants MUST be set appropriately for the settings in crt-royale.cgp
  (or whatever related .cgp file you're using).  If they aren't, you're likely
  to get artifacts, the wrong phosphor mask size, etc.  I wish these could be
  set directly in the .cgp file to make things easier, but...they can't.
  PASS SCALES AND RELATED CONSTANTS:
  Copy the absolute scale_x for BLOOM_APPROX.  There are two major versions of
  this shader: One does a viewport-scale bloom, and the other skips it.  The
  latter benefits from a higher bloom_approx_scale_x, so save both separately:
  Copy the viewport-relative scales of the phosphor mask resize passes
  (MASK_RESIZE and the pass immediately preceding it):
  Copy the geom_max_aspect_ratio used to calculate the MASK_RESIZE scales, etc.:
  PHOSPHOR MASK TEXTURE CONSTANTS:
  Set the following constants to reflect the properties of the phosphor mask
  texture named in crt-royale.cgp.  The shader optionally resizes a mask tile
  based on user settings, then repeats a single tile until filling the screen.
  The shader must know the input texture size (default 64x64), and to manually
  resize, it must also know the horizontal triads per tile (default 8).
  We need the average brightness of the phosphor mask to compensate for the
  dimming it causes.  The following four values are roughly correct for the
  masks included with the shader.  Update the value for any LUT texture you
  change.  [Un]comment "#define PHOSPHOR_MASK_GRILLE14" depending on whether
  the loaded aperture grille uses 14-pixel or 15-pixel stripes (default 15).
#define PHOSPHOR_MASK_GRILLE14

/////////////////////////////  FIXED SETTINGS  ///////////////////////////////
  Avoid dividing by zero; using a macro overloads for float, float2, etc.:
  Ensure the first pass decodes CRT gamma and the last encodes LCD gamma.
  Manually tiling a manually resized texture creates texture coord derivative
  discontinuities and confuses anisotropic filtering, causing discolored tile
  seams in the phosphor mask.  Workarounds:
  a.) Using tex2Dlod disables anisotropic filtering for tiled masks.  It's
      downgraded to tex2Dbias without DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DLOD #defined and
      disabled without DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DBIAS #defined either.
  b.) "Tile flat twice" requires drawing two full tiles without border padding
      to the resized mask FBO, and it's incompatible with same-pass curvature.
      (Same-pass curvature isn't used but could be in the future...maybe.)
  c.) "Fix discontinuities" requires derivatives and drawing one tile with
      border padding to the resized mask FBO, but it works with same-pass
      curvature.  It's disabled without DRIVERS_ALLOW_DERIVATIVES #defined.
  Precedence: a, then, b, then c (if multiple strategies are #defined).
  Also, manually resampling the phosphor mask is slightly blurrier with
  anisotropic filtering.  (Resampling with mipmapping is even worse: It
  creates artifacts, but only with the fully bloomed shader.)  The difference
  is subtle with small triads, but you can fix it for a small cost.
#define ANISOTROPIC_RESAMPLING_COMPAT_TEX2DLOD
////////////////////////////  DERIVED SETTINGS  //////////////////////////////
  Intel HD 4000 GPU's can't handle manual mask resizing (for now), setting the
  geometry mode at runtime, or a 4x4 true Gaussian resize.  Disable
  incompatible settings ASAP.  (INTEGRATED_GRAPHICS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE may be
  #defined by either user-settings.h or a wrapper .cg that #includes the
  current .cg pass.)
  Mode 2 (4x4 Gaussian resize) won't work, and mode 1 (3x3 blur) is
  inferior in most cases, so replace 2.0 with 0.0:
  Disable slow runtime paths if static parameters are used.  Most of these
  won't be a problem anyway once the params are disabled, but some will.
  Make tex2Dbias a backup for tex2Dlod for wider compatibility.
  Rule out unavailable anisotropic compatibility strategies:
  Prioritize anisotropic tiling compatibility strategies by performance and
  disable unused strategies.  This concentrates all the nesting in one place.
  ANISOTROPIC_TILING_COMPAT_TILE_FLAT_TWICE is only compatible with
  flat texture coords in the same pass, but that's all we use.
  The tex2Dlod and tex2Dbias strategies share a lot in common, and we can
  reduce some #ifdef nesting in the next section by essentially OR'ing them:
  Prioritize anisotropic resampling compatibility strategies the same way:
/////////////////////  DERIVED PHOSPHOR MASK CONSTANTS  //////////////////////
  If we can use the large mipmapped LUT without mipmapping artifacts, we
  should: It gives us more options for using fewer samples.
  TODO: Take advantage of this!
  tex2D's sampler2D parameter MUST be a uniform global, a uniform input to
  main_fragment, or a static alias of one of the above.  This makes it hard
  to select the phosphor mask at runtime: We can't even assign to a uniform
  global in the vertex shader or select a sampler2D in the vertex shader and
  pass it to the fragment shader (even with explicit TEXUNIT# bindings),
  because it just gives us the input texture or a black screen.  However, we
  can get around these limitations by calling tex2D three times with different
  uniform samplers (or resizing the phosphor mask three times altogether).
  With dynamic branches, we can process only one of these branches on top of
  quickly discarding fragments we don't need (cgc seems able to overcome
  limigations around dependent texture fetches inside of branches).  Without
  dynamic branches, we have to process every branch for every fragment...which
  is slower.  Runtime sampling mode selection is slower without dynamic
  branches as well.  Let the user's static #defines decide if it's worth it.
  We need to render some minimum number of tiles in the resize passes.
  We need at least 1.0 just to repeat a single tile, and we need extra
  padding beyond that for anisotropic filtering, discontinuitity fixing,
  antialiasing, same-pass curvature (not currently used), etc.  First
  determine how many border texels and tiles we need, based on how the result
  will be sampled:
  Most antialiasing filters have a base radius of 4.0 pixels:
  Anisotropic filtering adds about 0.5 to the pixel border:
  Fixing discontinuities adds 1.0 more to the pixel border:
  Convert the pixel border to an integer texel border.  Assume same-pass
  curvature about triples the texel frequency:
  Convert the texel border to a tile border using worst-case assumptions:
  Finally, set the number of resized tiles to render to MASK_RESIZE, and set
  the starting texel (inside borders) for sampling it.
  Special case: Render two tiles without borders.  Anisotropic
  filtering doesn't seem to be a problem here.
  We have to fit mask_resize_num_tiles into an FBO with a viewport scale of
  mask_resize_viewport_scale.  This limits the maximum final triad size.
  Estimate the minimum number of triads we can split the screen into in each
  dimension (we'll be as correct as mask_resize_viewport_scale is):
//////////////////////  COMMON MATHEMATICAL CONSTANTS  ///////////////////////
  We often want to find the location of the previous texel, e.g.:
      const float2 curr_texel = uv * texture_size;
      const float2 prev_texel = floor(curr_texel - float2(0.5)) + float2(0.5);
      const float2 prev_texel_uv = prev_texel / texture_size;
  However, many GPU drivers round incorrectly around exact texel locations.
  We need to subtract a little less than 0.5 before flooring, and some GPU's
  require this value to be farther from 0.5 than others; define it here.
      const float2 prev_texel =
          floor(curr_texel - float2(under_half)) + float2(0.5);

///////////////////////////  SETTINGS MANAGEMENT  ////////////////////////////
///////////////////////////  DRIVER CAPABILITIES  ////////////////////////////
  The Cg compiler uses different "profiles" with different capabilities.
  This shader requires a Cg compilation profile >= arbfp1, but a few options
  require higher profiles like fp30 or fp40.  The shader can't detect profile
  or driver capabilities, so instead you must comment or uncomment the lines
  below with "//" before "#define."  Disable an option if you get compilation
  errors resembling those listed.  Generally speaking, all of these options
  will run on nVidia cards, but only DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DBIAS (if that) is
  likely to run on ATI/AMD, due to the Cg compiler's profile limitations.
  Derivatives: Unsupported on fp20, ps_1_1, ps_1_2, ps_1_3, and arbfp1.
  Among other things, derivatives help us fix anisotropic filtering artifacts
  with curved manually tiled phosphor mask coords.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float2 ddx(float2);" not supported in this profile
  error C3004: function "float2 ddy(float2);" not supported in this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_DERIVATIVES
  Fine derivatives: Unsupported on older ATI cards.
  Fine derivatives enable 2x2 fragment block communication, letting us perform
  fast single-pass blur operations.  If your card uses coarse derivatives and
  these are enabled, blurs could look broken.  Derivatives are a prerequisite.
  Dynamic looping: Requires an fp30 or newer profile.
  This makes phosphor mask resampling faster in some cases.  Related errors:
  error C5013: profile does not support "for" statements and "for" could not
  be unrolled
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_BRANCHES
  Without DRIVERS_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_BRANCHES, we need to use unrollable loops.
  Using one static loop avoids overhead if the user is right, but if the user
  is wrong (loops are allowed), breaking a loop into if-blocked pieces with a
  binary search can potentially save some iterations.  However, it may fail:
  error C6001: Temporary register limit of 32 exceeded; 35 registers
  needed to compile program
#define ACCOMODATE_POSSIBLE_DYNAMIC_LOOPS
  tex2Dlod: Requires an fp40 or newer profile.  This can be used to disable
  anisotropic filtering, thereby fixing related artifacts.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float4 tex2Dlod(sampler2D, float4);" not supported in
  this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DLOD
  tex2Dbias: Requires an fp30 or newer profile.  This can be used to alleviate
  artifacts from anisotropic filtering and mipmapping.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float4 tex2Dbias(sampler2D, float4);" not supported
  in this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DBIAS
  Integrated graphics compatibility: Integrated graphics like Intel HD 4000
  impose stricter limitations on register counts and instructions.  Enable
  INTEGRATED_GRAPHICS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE if you still see error C6001 or:
  error C6002: Instruction limit of 1024 exceeded: 1523 instructions needed
  to compile program.
  Enabling integrated graphics compatibility mode will automatically disable:
  1.) PHOSPHOR_MASK_MANUALLY_RESIZE: The phosphor mask will be softer.
      (This may be reenabled in a later release.)
  2.) RUNTIME_GEOMETRY_MODE
  3.) The high-quality 4x4 Gaussian resize for the bloom approximation
#define INTEGRATED_GRAPHICS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE
//////////////////////////  USER CODEPATH OPTIONS  ///////////////////////////
  To disable a #define option, turn its line into a comment with "//.
  RUNTIME VS. COMPILE-TIME OPTIONS (Major Performance Implications):
  Enable runtime shader parameters in the Retroarch (etc.) GUI?  They override
  many of the options in this file and allow real-time tuning, but many of
  them are slower.  Disabling them and using this text file will boost FPS.
  Specify the phosphor bloom sigma at runtime?  This option is 10% slower, but
  it's the only way to do a wide-enough full bloom with a runtime dot pitch.
  Specify antialiasing weight parameters at runtime?  (Costs ~20% with cubics)
  Specify subpixel offsets at runtime? (WARNING: EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE!)
#define RUNTIME_ANTIALIAS_SUBPIXEL_OFFSETS
  Make beam_horiz_filter and beam_horiz_linear_rgb_weight into runtime shader
  parameters?  This will require more math or dynamic branching.
  Specify the tilt at runtime?  This makes things about 3% slower.
  Specify the geometry mode at runtime?
  Specify the phosphor mask type (aperture grille, slot mask, shadow mask) and
  mode (Lanczos-resize, hardware resize, or tile 1:1) at runtime, even without
  dynamic branches?  This is cheap if mask_resize_viewport_scale is small.
  PHOSPHOR MASK:
  Manually resize the phosphor mask for best results (slower)?  Disabling this
  removes the option to do so, but it may be faster without dynamic branches.
  If we sinc-resize the mask, should we Lanczos-window it (slower but better)?
  Larger blurs are expensive, but we need them to blur larger triads.  We can
  detect the right blur if the triad size is static or our profile allows
  dynamic branches, but otherwise we use the largest blur the user indicates
  they might need:
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_6_PIXELS
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_9_PIXELS
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_12_PIXELS
  Here's a helpful chart:

/////////////////////////////  USER PARAMETERS  //////////////////////////////
  Note: Many of these static parameters are overridden by runtime shader
  parameters when those are enabled.  However, many others are static codepath
  options that were cleaner or more convert to code as static constants.
  GAMMA:
  LEVELS MANAGEMENT:
  Control the final multiplicative image contrast:
  We auto-dim to avoid clipping between passes and restore brightness
  later.  Control the dim factor here: Lower values clip less but crush
  blacks more (static only for now).
  HALATION/DIFFUSION/BLOOM:
  Halation weight: How much energy should be lost to electrons bounding
  around under the CRT glass and exciting random phosphors?
  Refractive diffusion weight: How much light should spread/diffuse from
  refracting through the CRT glass?
  Underestimate brightness: Bright areas bloom more, but we can base the
  bloom brightpass on a lower brightness to sharpen phosphors, or a higher
  brightness to soften them.  Low values clip, but >= 0.8 looks okay.
  Blur all colors more than necessary for a softer phosphor bloom?
  The BLOOM_APPROX pass approximates a phosphor blur early on with a small
  blurred resize of the input (convergence offsets are applied as well).
  There are three filter options (static option only for now):
  0.) Bilinear resize: A fast, close approximation to a 4x4 resize
      if min_allowed_viewport_triads and the BLOOM_APPROX resolution are sane
      and beam_max_sigma is low.
  1.) 3x3 resize blur: Medium speed, soft/smeared from bilinear blurring,
      always uses a static sigma regardless of beam_max_sigma or
      mask_num_triads_desired.
  2.) True 4x4 Gaussian resize: Slowest, technically correct.
  These options are more pronounced for the fast, unbloomed shader version.
  ELECTRON BEAM SCANLINE DISTRIBUTION:
  How many scanlines should contribute light to each pixel?  Using more
  scanlines is slower (especially for a generalized Gaussian) but less
  distorted with larger beam sigmas (especially for a pure Gaussian).  The
  max_beam_sigma at which the closest unused weight is guaranteed <
  1.0/255.0 (for a 3x antialiased pure Gaussian) is:
      2 scanlines: max_beam_sigma = 0.2089; distortions begin ~0.34; 141.7 FPS pure, 131.9 FPS generalized
      3 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.3879; distortions begin ~0.52; 137.5 FPS pure; 123.8 FPS generalized
      4 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.5723; distortions begin ~0.70; 134.7 FPS pure; 117.2 FPS generalized
      5 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.7591; distortions begin ~0.89; 131.6 FPS pure; 112.1 FPS generalized
      6 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.9483; distortions begin ~1.08; 127.9 FPS pure; 105.6 FPS generalized
  A generalized Gaussian beam varies shape with color too, now just width.
  It's slower but more flexible (static option only for now).
  What kind of scanline antialiasing do you want?
  0: Sample weights at 1x; 1: Sample weights at 3x; 2: Compute an integral
  Integrals are slow (especially for generalized Gaussians) and rarely any
  better than 3x antialiasing (static option only for now).
  Min/max standard deviations for scanline beams: Higher values widen and
  soften scanlines.  Depending on other options, low min sigmas can alias.
  Beam width varies as a function of color: A power function (0) is more
  configurable, but a spherical function (1) gives the widest beam
  variability without aliasing (static option only for now).
  Spot shape power: Powers <= 1 give smoother spot shapes but lower
  sharpness.  Powers >= 1.0 are awful unless mix/max sigmas are close.
  Generalized Gaussian max shape parameters: Higher values give flatter
  scanline plateaus and steeper dropoffs, simultaneously widening and
  sharpening scanlines at the cost of aliasing.  2.0 is pure Gaussian, and
  values > ~40.0 cause artifacts with integrals.
  Generalized Gaussian shape power: Affects how quickly the distribution
  changes shape from Gaussian to steep/plateaued as color increases from 0
  to 1.0.  Higher powers appear softer for most colors, and lower powers
  appear sharper for most colors.
  What filter should be used to sample scanlines horizontally?
  0: Quilez (fast), 1: Gaussian (configurable), 2: Lanczos2 (sharp)
  Standard deviation for horizontal Gaussian resampling:
  Do horizontal scanline sampling in linear RGB (correct light mixing),
  gamma-encoded RGB (darker, hard spot shape, may better match bandwidth-
  limiting circuitry in some CRT's), or a weighted avg.?
  Simulate scanline misconvergence?  This needs 3x horizontal texture
  samples and 3x texture samples of BLOOM_APPROX and HALATION_BLUR in
  later passes (static option only for now).
  Convergence offsets in x/y directions for R/G/B scanline beams in units
  of scanlines.  Positive offsets go right/down; ranges [-2, 2]
  Detect interlacing (static option only for now)?
  Assume 1080-line sources are interlaced?
  For interlaced sources, assume TFF (top-field first) or BFF order?
  (Whether this matters depends on the nature of the interlaced input.)
  ANTIALIASING:
  What AA level do you want for curvature/overscan/subpixels?  Options:
  0x (none), 1x (sample subpixels), 4x, 5x, 6x, 7x, 8x, 12x, 16x, 20x, 24x
  (Static option only for now)
  What antialiasing filter do you want (static option only)?  Options:
  0: Box (separable), 1: Box (cylindrical),
  2: Tent (separable), 3: Tent (cylindrical),
  4: Gaussian (separable), 5: Gaussian (cylindrical),
  6: Cubic* (separable), 7: Cubic* (cylindrical, poor)
  8: Lanczos Sinc (separable), 9: Lanczos Jinc (cylindrical, poor)
      * = Especially slow with RUNTIME_ANTIALIAS_WEIGHTS
  Flip the sample grid on odd/even frames (static option only for now)?
  Use RGB subpixel offsets for antialiasing?  The pixel is at green, and
  the blue offset is the negative r offset; range [0, 0.5]
  Cubics: See http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/filter/#mitchell
  1.) "Keys cubics" with B = 1 - 2C are considered the highest quality.
  2.) C = 0.5 (default) is Catmull-Rom; higher C's apply sharpening.
  3.) C = 1.0/3.0 is the Mitchell-Netravali filter.
  4.) C = 0.0 is a soft spline filter.
  Standard deviation for Gaussian antialiasing: Try 0.5/aa_pixel_diameter.
  PHOSPHOR MASK:
  Mask type: 0 = aperture grille, 1 = slot mask, 2 = EDP shadow mask
  We can sample the mask three ways.  Pick 2/3 from: Pretty/Fast/Flexible.
  0.) Sinc-resize to the desired dot pitch manually (pretty/slow/flexible).
      This requires PHOSPHOR_MASK_MANUALLY_RESIZE to be #defined.
  1.) Hardware-resize to the desired dot pitch (ugly/fast/flexible).  This
      is halfway decent with LUT mipmapping but atrocious without it.
  2.) Tile it without resizing at a 1:1 texel:pixel ratio for flat coords
      (pretty/fast/inflexible).  Each input LUT has a fixed dot pitch.
      This mode reuses the same masks, so triads will be enormous unless
      you change the mask LUT filenames in your .cgp file.
  Prefer setting the triad size (0.0) or number on the screen (1.0)?
  If RUNTIME_PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_SIGMA isn't #defined, the specified triad size
  will always be used to calculate the full bloom sigma statically.
  Specify the phosphor triad size, in pixels.  Each tile (usually with 8
  triads) will be rounded to the nearest integer tile size and clamped to
  obey minimum size constraints (imposed to reduce downsize taps) and
  maximum size constraints (imposed to have a sane MASK_RESIZE FBO size).
  To increase the size limit, double the viewport-relative scales for the
  two MASK_RESIZE passes in crt-royale.cgp and user-cgp-contants.h.
      range [1, mask_texture_small_size/mask_triads_per_tile]
  If mask_specify_num_triads is 1.0/true, we'll go by this instead (the
  final size will be rounded and constrained as above); default 480.0
  How many lobes should the sinc/Lanczos resizer use?  More lobes require
  more samples and avoid moire a bit better, but some is unavoidable
  depending on the destination size (static option for now).
  The mask is resized using a variable number of taps in each dimension,
  but some Cg profiles always fetch a constant number of taps no matter
  what (no dynamic branching).  We can limit the maximum number of taps if
  we statically limit the minimum phosphor triad size.  Larger values are
  faster, but the limit IS enforced (static option only, forever);
      range [1, mask_texture_small_size/mask_triads_per_tile]
  TODO: Make this 1.0 and compensate with smarter sampling!
  GEOMETRY:
  Geometry mode:
  0: Off (default), 1: Spherical mapping (like cgwg's),
  2: Alt. spherical mapping (more bulbous), 3: Cylindrical/Trinitron
  Radius of curvature: Measured in units of your viewport's diagonal size.
  View dist is the distance from the player to their physical screen, in
  units of the viewport's diagonal size.  It controls the field of view.
  Tilt angle in radians (clockwise around up and right vectors):
  Aspect ratio: When the true viewport size is unknown, this value is used
  to help convert between the phosphor triad size and count, along with
  the mask_resize_viewport_scale constant from user-cgp-constants.h.  Set
  this equal to Retroarch's display aspect ratio (DAR) for best results;
  range [1, geom_max_aspect_ratio from user-cgp-constants.h];
  default (256/224)*(54/47) = 1.313069909 (see below)
  Before getting into overscan, here's some general aspect ratio info:
  - DAR = display aspect ratio = SAR * PAR; as in your Retroarch setting
  - SAR = storage aspect ratio = DAR / PAR; square pixel emulator frame AR
  - PAR = pixel aspect ratio   = DAR / SAR; holds regardless of cropping
  Geometry processing has to "undo" the screen-space 2D DAR to calculate
  3D view vectors, then reapplies the aspect ratio to the simulated CRT in
  uv-space.  To ensure the source SAR is intended for a ~4:3 DAR, either:
  a.) Enable Retroarch's "Crop Overscan
  b.) Readd horizontal padding: Set overscan to e.g. N*(1.0, 240.0/224.0)
  Real consoles use horizontal black padding in the signal, but emulators
  often crop this without cropping the vertical padding; a 256x224 [S]NES
  frame (8:7 SAR) is intended for a ~4:3 DAR, but a 256x240 frame is not.
  The correct [S]NES PAR is 54:47, found by blargg and NewRisingSun:
      http://board.zsnes.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=11928&start=50
      http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=24815#p24815
  For flat output, it's okay to set DAR = [existing] SAR * [correct] PAR
  without doing a. or b., but horizontal image borders will be tighter
  than vertical ones, messing up curvature and overscan.  Fixing the
  padding first corrects this.
  Overscan: Amount to "zoom in" before cropping.  You can zoom uniformly
  or adjust x/y independently to e.g. readd horizontal padding, as noted
  above: Values < 1.0 zoom out; range (0, inf)
  Compute a proper pixel-space to texture-space matrix even without ddx()/
  ddy()?  This is ~8.5% slower but improves antialiasing/subpixel filtering
  with strong curvature (static option only for now).
  BORDERS:
  Rounded border size in texture uv coords:
  Border darkness: Moderate values darken the border smoothly, and high
  values make the image very dark just inside the border:
  Border compression: High numbers compress border transitions, narrowing
  the dark border area.

///////////////////////////////  DESCRIPTION  ////////////////////////////////
  These macros and constants can be used across the whole codebase.
  Unlike the values in user-settings.cgh, end users shouldn't modify these.
////////////////////////////////  INCLUDES  //////////////////////////////////
///////////////////////////  DRIVER CAPABILITIES  ////////////////////////////
  The Cg compiler uses different "profiles" with different capabilities.
  This shader requires a Cg compilation profile >= arbfp1, but a few options
  require higher profiles like fp30 or fp40.  The shader can't detect profile
  or driver capabilities, so instead you must comment or uncomment the lines
  below with "//" before "#define."  Disable an option if you get compilation
  errors resembling those listed.  Generally speaking, all of these options
  will run on nVidia cards, but only DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DBIAS (if that) is
  likely to run on ATI/AMD, due to the Cg compiler's profile limitations.
  Derivatives: Unsupported on fp20, ps_1_1, ps_1_2, ps_1_3, and arbfp1.
  Among other things, derivatives help us fix anisotropic filtering artifacts
  with curved manually tiled phosphor mask coords.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float2 ddx(float2);" not supported in this profile
  error C3004: function "float2 ddy(float2);" not supported in this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_DERIVATIVES
  Fine derivatives: Unsupported on older ATI cards.
  Fine derivatives enable 2x2 fragment block communication, letting us perform
  fast single-pass blur operations.  If your card uses coarse derivatives and
  these are enabled, blurs could look broken.  Derivatives are a prerequisite.
  Dynamic looping: Requires an fp30 or newer profile.
  This makes phosphor mask resampling faster in some cases.  Related errors:
  error C5013: profile does not support "for" statements and "for" could not
  be unrolled
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_BRANCHES
  Without DRIVERS_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_BRANCHES, we need to use unrollable loops.
  Using one static loop avoids overhead if the user is right, but if the user
  is wrong (loops are allowed), breaking a loop into if-blocked pieces with a
  binary search can potentially save some iterations.  However, it may fail:
  error C6001: Temporary register limit of 32 exceeded; 35 registers
  needed to compile program
#define ACCOMODATE_POSSIBLE_DYNAMIC_LOOPS
  tex2Dlod: Requires an fp40 or newer profile.  This can be used to disable
  anisotropic filtering, thereby fixing related artifacts.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float4 tex2Dlod(sampler2D, float4);" not supported in
  this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DLOD
  tex2Dbias: Requires an fp30 or newer profile.  This can be used to alleviate
  artifacts from anisotropic filtering and mipmapping.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float4 tex2Dbias(sampler2D, float4);" not supported
  in this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DBIAS
  Integrated graphics compatibility: Integrated graphics like Intel HD 4000
  impose stricter limitations on register counts and instructions.  Enable
  INTEGRATED_GRAPHICS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE if you still see error C6001 or:
  error C6002: Instruction limit of 1024 exceeded: 1523 instructions needed
  to compile program.
  Enabling integrated graphics compatibility mode will automatically disable:
  1.) PHOSPHOR_MASK_MANUALLY_RESIZE: The phosphor mask will be softer.
      (This may be reenabled in a later release.)
  2.) RUNTIME_GEOMETRY_MODE
  3.) The high-quality 4x4 Gaussian resize for the bloom approximation
#define INTEGRATED_GRAPHICS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE
//////////////////////////  USER CODEPATH OPTIONS  ///////////////////////////
  To disable a #define option, turn its line into a comment with "//.
  RUNTIME VS. COMPILE-TIME OPTIONS (Major Performance Implications):
  Enable runtime shader parameters in the Retroarch (etc.) GUI?  They override
  many of the options in this file and allow real-time tuning, but many of
  them are slower.  Disabling them and using this text file will boost FPS.
  Specify the phosphor bloom sigma at runtime?  This option is 10% slower, but
  it's the only way to do a wide-enough full bloom with a runtime dot pitch.
  Specify antialiasing weight parameters at runtime?  (Costs ~20% with cubics)
  Specify subpixel offsets at runtime? (WARNING: EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE!)
#define RUNTIME_ANTIALIAS_SUBPIXEL_OFFSETS
  Make beam_horiz_filter and beam_horiz_linear_rgb_weight into runtime shader
  parameters?  This will require more math or dynamic branching.
  Specify the tilt at runtime?  This makes things about 3% slower.
  Specify the geometry mode at runtime?
  Specify the phosphor mask type (aperture grille, slot mask, shadow mask) and
  mode (Lanczos-resize, hardware resize, or tile 1:1) at runtime, even without
  dynamic branches?  This is cheap if mask_resize_viewport_scale is small.
  PHOSPHOR MASK:
  Manually resize the phosphor mask for best results (slower)?  Disabling this
  removes the option to do so, but it may be faster without dynamic branches.
  If we sinc-resize the mask, should we Lanczos-window it (slower but better)?
  Larger blurs are expensive, but we need them to blur larger triads.  We can
  detect the right blur if the triad size is static or our profile allows
  dynamic branches, but otherwise we use the largest blur the user indicates
  they might need:
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_6_PIXELS
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_9_PIXELS
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_12_PIXELS
  Here's a helpful chart:
  MaxTriadSize    BlurSize    MinTriadCountsByResolution
  3.0             9.0         480/640/960/1920 triads at 1080p/1440p/2160p/4320p, 4:3 aspect

/////////////////////////////  USER PARAMETERS  //////////////////////////////
  Note: Many of these static parameters are overridden by runtime shader
  parameters when those are enabled.  However, many others are static codepath
  options that were cleaner or more convert to code as static constants.
  GAMMA:
  LEVELS MANAGEMENT:
  Control the final multiplicative image contrast:
  We auto-dim to avoid clipping between passes and restore brightness
  later.  Control the dim factor here: Lower values clip less but crush
  blacks more (static only for now).
  HALATION/DIFFUSION/BLOOM:
  Halation weight: How much energy should be lost to electrons bounding
  around under the CRT glass and exciting random phosphors?
  Refractive diffusion weight: How much light should spread/diffuse from
  refracting through the CRT glass?
  Underestimate brightness: Bright areas bloom more, but we can base the
  bloom brightpass on a lower brightness to sharpen phosphors, or a higher
  brightness to soften them.  Low values clip, but >= 0.8 looks okay.
  Blur all colors more than necessary for a softer phosphor bloom?
  The BLOOM_APPROX pass approximates a phosphor blur early on with a small
  blurred resize of the input (convergence offsets are applied as well).
  There are three filter options (static option only for now):
  0.) Bilinear resize: A fast, close approximation to a 4x4 resize
      if min_allowed_viewport_triads and the BLOOM_APPROX resolution are sane
      and beam_max_sigma is low.
  1.) 3x3 resize blur: Medium speed, soft/smeared from bilinear blurring,
      always uses a static sigma regardless of beam_max_sigma or
      mask_num_triads_desired.
  2.) True 4x4 Gaussian resize: Slowest, technically correct.
  These options are more pronounced for the fast, unbloomed shader version.
  ELECTRON BEAM SCANLINE DISTRIBUTION:
  How many scanlines should contribute light to each pixel?  Using more
  scanlines is slower (especially for a generalized Gaussian) but less
  distorted with larger beam sigmas (especially for a pure Gaussian).  The
  max_beam_sigma at which the closest unused weight is guaranteed <
  1.0/255.0 (for a 3x antialiased pure Gaussian) is:
      2 scanlines: max_beam_sigma = 0.2089; distortions begin ~0.34; 141.7 FPS pure, 131.9 FPS generalized
      3 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.3879; distortions begin ~0.52; 137.5 FPS pure; 123.8 FPS generalized
      4 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.5723; distortions begin ~0.70; 134.7 FPS pure; 117.2 FPS generalized
      5 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.7591; distortions begin ~0.89; 131.6 FPS pure; 112.1 FPS generalized
      6 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.9483; distortions begin ~1.08; 127.9 FPS pure; 105.6 FPS generalized
  A generalized Gaussian beam varies shape with color too, now just width.
  It's slower but more flexible (static option only for now).
  What kind of scanline antialiasing do you want?
  0: Sample weights at 1x; 1: Sample weights at 3x; 2: Compute an integral

  Generalized Gaussian shape power: Affects how quickly the distribution
  changes shape from Gaussian to steep/plateaued as color increases from 0
  to 1.0.  Higher powers appear softer for most colors, and lower powers
  appear sharper for most colors.
  What filter should be used to sample scanlines horizontally?
  0: Quilez (fast), 1: Gaussian (configurable), 2: Lanczos2 (sharp)
  Standard deviation for horizontal Gaussian resampling:
  Do horizontal scanline sampling in linear RGB (correct light mixing),
  gamma-encoded RGB (darker, hard spot shape, may better match bandwidth-
  limiting circuitry in some CRT's), or a weighted avg.?
  Simulate scanline misconvergence?  This needs 3x horizontal texture
  samples and 3x texture samples of BLOOM_APPROX and HALATION_BLUR in
  later passes (static option only for now).
  Convergence offsets in x/y directions for R/G/B scanline beams in units
  of scanlines.  Positive offsets go right/down; ranges [-2, 2]
  Detect interlacing (static option only for now)?
  Assume 1080-line sources are interlaced?
  For interlaced sources, assume TFF (top-field first) or BFF order?
  (Whether this matters depends on the nature of the interlaced input.)
  ANTIALIASING:

  - SAR = storage aspect ratio = DAR / PAR; square pixel emulator frame AR
  - PAR = pixel aspect ratio   = DAR / SAR; holds regardless of cropping
  Geometry processing has to "undo" the screen-space 2D DAR to calculate
  3D view vectors, then reapplies the aspect ratio to the simulated CRT in
  uv-space.  To ensure the source SAR is intended for a ~4:3 DAR, either:
  a.) Enable Retroarch's "Crop Overscan
  b.) Readd horizontal padding: Set overscan to e.g. N*(1.0, 240.0/224.0)
  Real consoles use horizontal black padding in the signal, but emulators
  often crop this without cropping the vertical padding; a 256x224 [S]NES
  frame (8:7 SAR) is intended for a ~4:3 DAR, but a 256x240 frame is not.
  The correct [S]NES PAR is 54:47, found by blargg and NewRisingSun:
      http://board.zsnes.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=11928&start=50
      http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=24815#p24815
  For flat output, it's okay to set DAR = [existing] SAR * [correct] PAR
  without doing a. or b., but horizontal image borders will be tighter
  than vertical ones, messing up curvature and overscan.  Fixing the
  padding first corrects this.
  Overscan: Amount to "zoom in" before cropping.  You can zoom uniformly
  or adjust x/y independently to e.g. readd horizontal padding, as noted
  above: Values < 1.0 zoom out; range (0, inf)
  Compute a proper pixel-space to texture-space matrix even without ddx()/
  ddy()?  This is ~8.5% slower but improves antialiasing/subpixel filtering
  with strong curvature (static option only for now).
  BORDERS:
  Rounded border size in texture uv coords:
  Border darkness: Moderate values darken the border smoothly, and high
  values make the image very dark just inside the border:
  Border compression: High numbers compress border transitions, narrowing
  the dark border area.
  IMPORTANT:
  These constants MUST be set appropriately for the settings in crt-royale.cgp
  (or whatever related .cgp file you're using).  If they aren't, you're likely
  to get artifacts, the wrong phosphor mask size, etc.  I wish these could be
  set directly in the .cgp file to make things easier, but...they can't.
  PASS SCALES AND RELATED CONSTANTS:
  Copy the absolute scale_x for BLOOM_APPROX.  There are two major versions of
  this shader: One does a viewport-scale bloom, and the other skips it.  The
  latter benefits from a higher bloom_approx_scale_x, so save both separately:
  Copy the viewport-relative scales of the phosphor mask resize passes
  (MASK_RESIZE and the pass immediately preceding it):
  Copy the geom_max_aspect_ratio used to calculate the MASK_RESIZE scales, etc.:
  PHOSPHOR MASK TEXTURE CONSTANTS:
  Set the following constants to reflect the properties of the phosphor mask
  texture named in crt-royale.cgp.  The shader optionally resizes a mask tile
  based on user settings, then repeats a single tile until filling the screen.
  The shader must know the input texture size (default 64x64), and to manually
  resize, it must also know the horizontal triads per tile (default 8).
  We need the average brightness of the phosphor mask to compensate for the
  dimming it causes.  The following four values are roughly correct for the
  masks included with the shader.  Update the value for any LUT texture you
  change.  [Un]comment "#define PHOSPHOR_MASK_GRILLE14" depending on whether
  the loaded aperture grille uses 14-pixel or 15-pixel stripes (default 15).
#define PHOSPHOR_MASK_GRILLE14

/////////////////////////////  FIXED SETTINGS  ///////////////////////////////
  Avoid dividing by zero; using a macro overloads for float, float2, etc.:
  Ensure the first pass decodes CRT gamma and the last encodes LCD gamma.
  Manually tiling a manually resized texture creates texture coord derivative
  discontinuities and confuses anisotropic filtering, causing discolored tile
  seams in the phosphor mask.  Workarounds:
  a.) Using tex2Dlod disables anisotropic filtering for tiled masks.  It's
      downgraded to tex2Dbias without DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DLOD #defined and
      disabled without DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DBIAS #defined either.
  b.) "Tile flat twice" requires drawing two full tiles without border padding
      to the resized mask FBO, and it's incompatible with same-pass curvature.
      (Same-pass curvature isn't used but could be in the future...maybe.)
  c.) "Fix discontinuities" requires derivatives and drawing one tile with
      border padding to the resized mask FBO, but it works with same-pass
      curvature.  It's disabled without DRIVERS_ALLOW_DERIVATIVES #defined.
  Precedence: a, then, b, then c (if multiple strategies are #defined).
  Also, manually resampling the phosphor mask is slightly blurrier with
  anisotropic filtering.  (Resampling with mipmapping is even worse: It
  creates artifacts, but only with the fully bloomed shader.)  The difference
  is subtle with small triads, but you can fix it for a small cost.
#define ANISOTROPIC_RESAMPLING_COMPAT_TEX2DLOD
////////////////////////////  DERIVED SETTINGS  //////////////////////////////
  Intel HD 4000 GPU's can't handle manual mask resizing (for now), setting the
  geometry mode at runtime, or a 4x4 true Gaussian resize.  Disable
  incompatible settings ASAP.  (INTEGRATED_GRAPHICS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE may be
  #defined by either user-settings.h or a wrapper .cg that #includes the
  current .cg pass.)
  Mode 2 (4x4 Gaussian resize) won't work, and mode 1 (3x3 blur) is
  inferior in most cases, so replace 2.0 with 0.0:
  Disable slow runtime paths if static parameters are used.  Most of these
  won't be a problem anyway once the params are disabled, but some will.
  Make tex2Dbias a backup for tex2Dlod for wider compatibility.
  Rule out unavailable anisotropic compatibility strategies:
  Prioritize anisotropic tiling compatibility strategies by performance and
  disable unused strategies.  This concentrates all the nesting in one place.
  ANISOTROPIC_TILING_COMPAT_TILE_FLAT_TWICE is only compatible with
  flat texture coords in the same pass, but that's all we use.
  The tex2Dlod and tex2Dbias strategies share a lot in common, and we can
  reduce some #ifdef nesting in the next section by essentially OR'ing them:
  Prioritize anisotropic resampling compatibility strategies the same way:
/////////////////////  DERIVED PHOSPHOR MASK CONSTANTS  //////////////////////
  If we can use the large mipmapped LUT without mipmapping artifacts, we
  should: It gives us more options for using fewer samples.
  TODO: Take advantage of this!
  tex2D's sampler2D parameter MUST be a uniform global, a uniform input to
  main_fragment, or a static alias of one of the above.  This makes it hard
  to select the phosphor mask at runtime: We can't even assign to a uniform
  global in the vertex shader or select a sampler2D in the vertex shader and
  pass it to the fragment shader (even with explicit TEXUNIT# bindings),
  because it just gives us the input texture or a black screen.  However, we
  can get around these limitations by calling tex2D three times with different
  uniform samplers (or resizing the phosphor mask three times altogether).
  With dynamic branches, we can process only one of these branches on top of
  quickly discarding fragments we don't need (cgc seems able to overcome
  limigations around dependent texture fetches inside of branches).  Without
  dynamic branches, we have to process every branch for every fragment...which
  is slower.  Runtime sampling mode selection is slower without dynamic
  branches as well.  Let the user's static #defines decide if it's worth it.
  We need to render some minimum number of tiles in the resize passes.
  We need at least 1.0 just to repeat a single tile, and we need extra
  padding beyond that for anisotropic filtering, discontinuitity fixing,
  antialiasing, same-pass curvature (not currently used), etc.  First
  determine how many border texels and tiles we need, based on how the result
  will be sampled:
  Most antialiasing filters have a base radius of 4.0 pixels:
  Anisotropic filtering adds about 0.5 to the pixel border:
  Fixing discontinuities adds 1.0 more to the pixel border:
  Convert the pixel border to an integer texel border.  Assume same-pass
  curvature about triples the texel frequency:
  Convert the texel border to a tile border using worst-case assumptions:
  Finally, set the number of resized tiles to render to MASK_RESIZE, and set
  the starting texel (inside borders) for sampling it.
  Special case: Render two tiles without borders.  Anisotropic
  filtering doesn't seem to be a problem here.
  We have to fit mask_resize_num_tiles into an FBO with a viewport scale of
  mask_resize_viewport_scale.  This limits the maximum final triad size.
  Estimate the minimum number of triads we can split the screen into in each
  dimension (we'll be as correct as mask_resize_viewport_scale is):
//////////////////////  COMMON MATHEMATICAL CONSTANTS  ///////////////////////
  We often want to find the location of the previous texel, e.g.:
      const float2 curr_texel = uv * texture_size;
      const float2 prev_texel = floor(curr_texel - float2(0.5)) + float2(0.5);
      const float2 prev_texel_uv = prev_texel / texture_size;
  However, many GPU drivers round incorrectly around exact texel locations.
  We need to subtract a little less than 0.5 before flooring, and some GPU's
  require this value to be farther from 0.5 than others; define it here.
      const float2 prev_texel =
          floor(curr_texel - float2(under_half)) + float2(0.5);
  Override some parameters for gamma-management.h and tex2Dantialias.h:
  Disable runtime shader params if the user doesn't explicitly want them.
  Static constants will be defined in place of uniforms of the same name.
  Bind option names to shader parameter uniforms or static constants.
  Use constants from user-settings.h, and limit ranges appropriately:
  Unpack static vector elements to match scalar uniforms:
#define interlace_bff global.interlace_bff
  Provide accessors for vector constants that pack scalar uniforms:
  Get an aspect ratio vector.  Enforce geom_max_aspect_ratio, and prevent
  the absolute scale from affecting the uv-mapping for curvature:
  WARNING: THIS IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.
  Provide accessors settings which still need "cooking:
  Create a local-to-global rotation matrix for the CRT's coordinate frame
  and its global-to-local inverse.  See the vertex shader for details.
  It's faster to compute these statically if possible.

///////////////////////////////  DESCRIPTION  ////////////////////////////////
  This file provides gamma-aware tex*D*() and encode_output() functions.
  Requires:   Before #include-ing this file, the including file must #define
              the following macros when applicable and follow their rules:
              1.) #define FIRST_PASS if this is the first pass.
              2.) #define LAST_PASS if this is the last pass.
              3.) If sRGB is available, set srgb_framebufferN = "true" for
                  every pass except the last in your .cgp preset.
              4.) If sRGB isn't available but you want gamma-correctness with
                  no banding, #define GAMMA_ENCODE_EVERY_FBO each pass.
              5.) #define SIMULATE_CRT_ON_LCD if desired (precedence over 5-7)
              6.) #define SIMULATE_GBA_ON_LCD if desired (precedence over 6-7)
              7.) #define SIMULATE_LCD_ON_CRT if desired (precedence over 7)
              8.) #define SIMULATE_GBA_ON_CRT if desired (precedence over -)
              If an option in [5, 8] is #defined in the first or last pass, it
              should be #defined for both.  It shouldn't make a difference
              whether it's #defined for intermediate passes or not.
  Optional:   The including file (or an earlier included file) may optionally
              #define a number of macros indicating it will override certain
              macros and associated constants are as follows:
              static constants with either static or uniform constants.  The
              1.) OVERRIDE_STANDARD_GAMMA: The user must first define:
                  static const float ntsc_gamma
                  static const float pal_gamma
                  static const float crt_reference_gamma_high
                  static const float crt_reference_gamma_low
                  static const float lcd_reference_gamma
                  static const float crt_office_gamma
                  static const float lcd_office_gamma
              2.) OVERRIDE_DEVICE_GAMMA: The user must first define:
                  static const float crt_gamma
                  static const float gba_gamma
                  static const float lcd_gamma
              3.) OVERRIDE_FINAL_GAMMA: The user must first define:
                  static const float input_gamma
                  static const float intermediate_gamma
                  static const float output_gamma
                  (intermediate_gamma is for GAMMA_ENCODE_EVERY_FBO.)
              4.) OVERRIDE_ALPHA_ASSUMPTIONS: The user must first define:
                  static const bool assume_opaque_alpha
              The gamma constant overrides must be used in every pass or none,
              and OVERRIDE_FINAL_GAMMA bypasses all of the SIMULATE* macros.
              OVERRIDE_ALPHA_ASSUMPTIONS may be set on a per-pass basis.
  Usage:      After setting macros appropriately, ignore gamma correction and
              replace all tex*D*() calls with equivalent gamma-aware
              tex*D*_linearize calls, except:
              1.) When you read an LUT, use regular tex*D or a gamma-specified
                  function, depending on its gamma encoding:
                      tex*D*_linearize_gamma (takes a runtime gamma parameter)
              2.) If you must read pass0's original input in a later pass, use
                  tex2D_linearize_ntsc_gamma.  If you want to read pass0's
                  input with gamma-corrected bilinear filtering, consider
                  creating a first linearizing pass and reading from the input
                  of pass1 later.
              Then, return encode_output(color) from every fragment shader.
              Finally, use the global gamma_aware_bilinear boolean if you want
              to statically branch based on whether bilinear filtering is
              gamma-correct or not (e.g. for placing Gaussian blur samples).

  Detailed Policy:
  tex*D*_linearize() functions enforce a consistent gamma-management policy
  based on the FIRST_PASS and GAMMA_ENCODE_EVERY_FBO settings.  They assume
  their input texture has the same encoding characteristics as the input for
  the current pass (which doesn't apply to the exceptions listed above).
  Similarly, encode_output() enforces a policy based on the LAST_PASS and
  GAMMA_ENCODE_EVERY_FBO settings.  Together, they result in one of the
  following two pipelines.
  Typical pipeline with intermediate sRGB framebuffers:
      linear_color = pow(pass0_encoded_color, input_gamma);
      intermediate_output = linear_color;     //  Automatic sRGB encoding
      linear_color = intermediate_output;     //  Automatic sRGB decoding
      final_output = pow(intermediate_output, 1.0/output_gamma);
  Typical pipeline without intermediate sRGB framebuffers:
      linear_color = pow(pass0_encoded_color, input_gamma);
      intermediate_output = pow(linear_color, 1.0/intermediate_gamma);
      linear_color = pow(intermediate_output, intermediate_gamma);
      final_output = pow(intermediate_output, 1.0/output_gamma);
  Using GAMMA_ENCODE_EVERY_FBO is much slower, but it's provided as a way to
  easily get gamma-correctness without banding on devices where sRGB isn't
  supported.

  Use This Header to Maximize Code Reuse:
  The purpose of this header is to provide a consistent interface for texture
  reads and output gamma-encoding that localizes and abstracts away all the
  annoying details.  This greatly reduces the amount of code in each shader
  pass that depends on the pass number in the .cgp preset or whether sRGB
  FBO's are being used: You can trivially change the gamma behavior of your
  whole pass by commenting or uncommenting 1-3 #defines.  To reuse the same
  code in your first, Nth, and last passes, you can even put it all in another
  header file and #include it from skeleton .cg files that #define the
  appropriate pass-specific settings.

  Rationale for Using Three Macros:
  This file uses GAMMA_ENCODE_EVERY_FBO instead of an opposite macro like
  SRGB_PIPELINE to ensure sRGB is assumed by default, which hopefully imposes
  a lower maintenance burden on each pass.  At first glance it seems we could
  accomplish everything with two macros: GAMMA_CORRECT_IN / GAMMA_CORRECT_OUT.
  This works for simple use cases where input_gamma == output_gamma, but it
  breaks down for more complex scenarios like CRT simulation, where the pass
  number determines the gamma encoding of the input and output.
/////////////////////////////  BASE CONSTANTS  ///////////////////////////////
  Set standard gamma constants, but allow users to override them:
  Standard encoding gammas:
  Typical device decoding gammas (only use for emulating devices):
  CRT/LCD reference gammas are higher than NTSC and Rec.709 video standard
  gammas: The standards purposely undercorrected for an analog CRT's
  assumed 2.5 reference display gamma to maintain contrast in assumed
  [dark] viewing conditions: http://www.poynton.com/PDFs/GammaFAQ.pdf
  These unstated assumptions about display gamma and perceptual rendering
  intent caused a lot of confusion, and more modern CRT's seemed to target
  NTSC 2.2 gamma with circuitry.  LCD displays seem to have followed suit
  (they struggle near black with 2.5 gamma anyway), especially PC/laptop
  displays designed to view sRGB in bright environments.  (Standards are
  also in flux again with BT.1886, but it's underspecified for displays.)
  Assuming alpha == 1.0 might make it easier for users to avoid some bugs,
  but only if they're aware of it.
/////////////////////  DERIVED CONSTANTS AS FUNCTIONS  ///////////////////////
  gamma-management.h should be compatible with overriding gamma values with
  runtime user parameters, but we can only define other global constants in
  terms of static constants, not uniform user parameters.  To get around this
  limitation, we need to define derived constants using functions.
  Set device gamma constants, but allow users to override them:
  The user promises to globally define the appropriate constants:
  Set decoding/encoding gammas for the first/lass passes, but allow overrides:
  The user promises to globally define the appropriate constants:
  If we gamma-correct every pass, always use ntsc_gamma between passes to
  ensure middle passes don't need to care if anything is being simulated:
  Set decoding/encoding gammas for the current pass.  Use static constants for
  linearize_input and gamma_encode_output, because they aren't derived, and
  they let the compiler do dead-code elimination.
  Users might want to know if bilinear filtering will be gamma-correct:

/////////////////////////  TEXTURE LOOKUP WRAPPERS  //////////////////////////
  "SMART" LINEARIZING TEXTURE LOOKUP FUNCTIONS:
  Provide a wide array of linearizing texture lookup wrapper functions.  The
  Cg shader spec Retroarch uses only allows for 2D textures, but 1D and 3D
  lookups are provided for completeness in case that changes someday.  Nobody
  is likely to use the *fetch and *proj functions, but they're included just
  in case.  The only tex*D texture sampling functions omitted are:
      - tex*Dcmpbias
      - tex*Dcmplod
      - tex*DARRAY*
      - tex*DMS*

///////////////////////////////  DESCRIPTION  ////////////////////////////////
  This file provides antialiased and subpixel-aware tex2D lookups.
  Requires:   All functions share these requirements:
              1.) All requirements of gamma-management.h must be satisfied!
              2.) pixel_to_tex_uv must be a 2x2 matrix that transforms pixe-
                  space offsets to texture uv offsets.  You can get this with:
                      const float2 duv_dx = ddx(tex_uv);
                      const float2 duv_dy = ddy(tex_uv);
                      const float2x2 pixel_to_tex_uv = float2x2(
                          duv_dx.x, duv_dy.x,
                          duv_dx.y, duv_dy.y);
                  This is left to the user in case the current Cg profile
                  doesn't support ddx()/ddy().  Ideally, the user could find
                  calculate a distorted tangent-space mapping analytically.
                  If not, a simple flat mapping can be obtained with:
                      const float2 xy_to_uv_scale = IN.output_size *
                          IN.video_size/IN.texture_size;
                      const float2x2 pixel_to_tex_uv = float2x2(
                          xy_to_uv_scale.x, 0.0,
                          0.0, xy_to_uv_scale.y);
  Optional:   To set basic AA settings, #define ANTIALIAS_OVERRIDE_BASICS and:
              1.) Set an antialiasing level:
                      static const float aa_level = {0 (none),
                          1 (sample subpixels), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24}
              2.) Set a filter type:
                      static const float aa_filter = {
                          0 (Box, Separable), 1 (Box, Cylindrical),
                          2 (Tent, Separable), 3 (Tent, Cylindrical)
                          4 (Gaussian, Separable), 5 (Gaussian, Cylindrical)
                          6 (Cubic, Separable), 7 (Cubic, Cylindrical)
                          8 (Lanczos Sinc, Separable),
                          9 (Lanczos Jinc, Cylindrical)}
                  If the input is unknown, a separable box filter is used.
                  Note: Lanczos Jinc is terrible for sparse sampling, and
                  using aa_axis_importance (see below) defeats the purpose.
              3.) Mirror the sample pattern on odd frames?
                      static const bool aa_temporal = {true, false]
                  This helps rotational invariance but can look "fluttery.
              The user may #define ANTIALIAS_OVERRIDE_PARAMETERS to override
              (all of) the following default parameters with static or uniform
              constants (or an accessor function for subpixel offsets):
              1.) Cubic parameters:
                      static const float aa_cubic_c = 0.5;
                  See http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/filter/#mitchell
              2.) Gaussian parameters:
                      static const float aa_gauss_sigma =
                          0.5/aa_pixel_diameter;
              3.) Set subpixel offsets.  This requires an accessor function
                  for compatibility with scalar runtime shader params.  Return
                  a float2 pixel offset in [-0.5, 0.5] for the red subpixel:
                      float2 get_aa_subpixel_r_offset()
              The user may also #define ANTIALIAS_OVERRIDE_STATIC_CONSTANTS to
              override (all of) the following default static values.  However,
              the file's structure requires them to be declared static const:
              1.) static const float aa_lanczos_lobes = 3.0;
              2.) static const float aa_gauss_support = 1.0/aa_pixel_diameter;
                  Note the default tent/Gaussian support radii may appear
                  arbitrary, but extensive testing found them nearly optimal
                  for tough cases like strong distortion at low AA levels.
                  (The Gaussian default is only best for practical gauss_sigma
                  values; much larger gauss_sigmas ironically prefer slightly
                  smaller support given sparse sampling, and vice versa.)
              3.) static const float aa_tent_support = 1.0 / aa_pixel_diameter;
              4.) static const float2 aa_xy_axis_importance:
                  The sparse N-queens sampling grid interacts poorly with
                  negative-lobed 2D filters.  However, if aliasing is much
                  stronger in one direction (e.g. horizontally with a phosphor
                  mask), it can be useful to downplay sample offsets along the
                  other axis.  The support radius in each direction scales with
                  aa_xy_axis_importance down to a minimum of 0.5 (box support),
                  after which point only the offsets used for calculating
                  weights continue to scale downward.  This works as follows:
                  If aa_xy_axis_importance = float2(1.0, 1.0/support_radius),
                  the vertical support radius will drop to 1.0, and we'll just
                  filter vertical offsets with the first filter lobe, while
                  horizontal offsets go through the full multi-lobe filter.
                  If aa_xy_axis_importance = float2(1.0, 0.0), the vertical
                  support radius will drop to box support, and the vertical
                  offsets will be ignored entirely (essentially giving us a
                  box filter vertically).  The former is potentially smoother
                  (but less predictable) and the default behavior of Lanczos
                  jinc, whereas the latter is sharper and the default behavior
                  of cubics and Lanczos sinc.
              5.) static const float aa_pixel_diameter: You can expand the
                  pixel diameter to e.g. sqrt(2.0), which may be a better
                  support range for cylindrical filters (they don't
                  currently discard out-of-circle samples though).
              Finally, there are two miscellaneous options:
              1.) If you want to antialias a manually tiled texture, you can
                  #define ANTIALIAS_DISABLE_ANISOTROPIC to use tex2Dlod() to
                  fix incompatibilities with anisotropic filtering.  This is
                  slower, and the Cg profile must support tex2Dlod().
              2.) If aa_cubic_c is a runtime uniform, you can #define
                  RUNTIME_ANTIALIAS_WEIGHTS to evaluate cubic weights once per
                  fragment instead of at the usage site (which is used by
                  default, because it enables static evaluation).
  Description:
  Each antialiased lookup follows these steps:
  1.) Define a sample pattern of pixel offsets in the range of [-0.5, 0.5]
      pixels, spanning the diameter of a rectangular box filter.
  2.) Scale these offsets by the support diameter of the user's chosen filter.
  3.) Using these pixel offsets from the pixel center, compute the offsets to
      predefined subpixel locations.
  4.) Compute filter weights based on subpixel offsets.
  Much of that can often be done at compile-time.  At runtime:
  1.) Project pixel-space offsets into uv-space with a matrix multiplication
      to get the uv offsets for each sample.  Rectangular pixels have a
      diameter of 1.0.  Circular pixels are not currently supported, but they
      might be better with a diameter of sqrt(2.0) to ensure there are no gaps
      between them.
  2.) Load, weight, and sum samples.
  We use a sparse bilinear sampling grid, so there are two major implications:
  1.) We can directly project the pixel-space support box into uv-space even
      if we're upsizing.  This wouldn't be the case for nearest neighbor,
      where we'd have to expand the uv-space diameter to at least the support
      size to ensure sufficient filter support.  In our case, this allows us
      to treat upsizing the same as downsizing and use static weighting. :)
  2.) For decent results, negative-lobed filters must be computed based on
      separable weights, not radial distances, because the sparse sampling
      makes no guarantees about radial distributions.  Even then, it's much
      better to set aa_xy_axis_importance to e.g. float2(1.0, 0.0) to use e.g.
      Lanczos2 horizontally and a box filter vertically.  This is mainly due
      to the sparse N-queens sampling and a statistically enormous positive or
      negative covariance between horizontal and vertical weights.

  Design Decision Comments:
  "aa_temporal" mirrors the sample pattern on odd frames along the axis that
  keeps subpixel weights constant.  This helps with rotational invariance, but
  it can cause distracting fluctuations, and horizontal and vertical edges
  will look the same.  Using a different pattern on a shifted grid would
  exploit temporal AA better, but it would require a dynamic branch or a lot
  of conditional moves, so it's prohibitively slow for the minor benefit.
///////////////////////////  SETTINGS MANAGEMENT  ////////////////////////////
  The following settings must be static constants:
  Users may override these parameters, but the file structure requires
  them to be static constants; see the descriptions above.
  If we're using a negative-lobed filter, default to using it horizontally
  only, and use only the first lobe vertically or a box filter, over a
  correspondingly smaller range.  This compensates for the sparse sampling
  grid's typically large positive/negative x/y covariance.
  Users may override these values with their own uniform or static consts.
  Cubics: See http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/filter/#mitchell
  1.) "Keys cubics" with B = 1 - 2C are considered the highest quality.
  2.) C = 0.5 (default) is Catmull-Rom; higher C's apply sharpening.
  3.) C = 1.0/3.0 is the Mitchell-Netravali filter.
  4.) C = 0.0 is a soft spline filter.
  Users may override the subpixel offset accessor function with their own.
  A function is used for compatibility with scalar runtime shader params.

///////////////////////////////  DESCRIPTION  ////////////////////////////////
  This file provides gamma-aware tex*D*() and encode_output() functions.
  Requires:   Before #include-ing this file, the including file must #define
              the following macros when applicable and follow their rules:
              1.) #define FIRST_PASS if this is the first pass.
              2.) #define LAST_PASS if this is the last pass.
              3.) If sRGB is available, set srgb_framebufferN = "true" for
                  every pass except the last in your .cgp preset.
              4.) If sRGB isn't available but you want gamma-correctness with
                  no banding, #define GAMMA_ENCODE_EVERY_FBO each pass.
              5.) #define SIMULATE_CRT_ON_LCD if desired (precedence over 5-7)
              6.) #define SIMULATE_GBA_ON_LCD if desired (precedence over 6-7)
              7.) #define SIMULATE_LCD_ON_CRT if desired (precedence over 7)
              8.) #define SIMULATE_GBA_ON_CRT if desired (precedence over -)
              If an option in [5, 8] is #defined in the first or last pass, it
              should be #defined for both.  It shouldn't make a difference
              whether it's #defined for intermediate passes or not.
  Optional:   The including file (or an earlier included file) may optionally
              #define a number of macros indicating it will override certain
              macros and associated constants are as follows:
              static constants with either static or uniform constants.  The
              1.) OVERRIDE_STANDARD_GAMMA: The user must first define:
                  static const float ntsc_gamma
                  static const float pal_gamma
                  static const float crt_reference_gamma_high
                  static const float crt_reference_gamma_low
                  static const float lcd_reference_gamma
                  static const float crt_office_gamma
                  static const float lcd_office_gamma
              2.) OVERRIDE_DEVICE_GAMMA: The user must first define:
                  static const float crt_gamma
                  static const float gba_gamma
                  static const float lcd_gamma
              3.) OVERRIDE_FINAL_GAMMA: The user must first define:
                  static const float input_gamma
                  static const float intermediate_gamma
                  static const float output_gamma
                  (intermediate_gamma is for GAMMA_ENCODE_EVERY_FBO.)
              4.) OVERRIDE_ALPHA_ASSUMPTIONS: The user must first define:
                  static const bool assume_opaque_alpha
              The gamma constant overrides must be used in every pass or none,
              and OVERRIDE_FINAL_GAMMA bypasses all of the SIMULATE* macros.
              OVERRIDE_ALPHA_ASSUMPTIONS may be set on a per-pass basis.
  Usage:      After setting macros appropriately, ignore gamma correction and
              replace all tex*D*() calls with equivalent gamma-aware
              tex*D*_linearize calls, except:
              1.) When you read an LUT, use regular tex*D or a gamma-specified
                  function, depending on its gamma encoding:
                      tex*D*_linearize_gamma (takes a runtime gamma parameter)
              2.) If you must read pass0's original input in a later pass, use
                  tex2D_linearize_ntsc_gamma.  If you want to read pass0's
                  input with gamma-corrected bilinear filtering, consider
                  creating a first linearizing pass and reading from the input
                  of pass1 later.
              Then, return encode_output(color) from every fragment shader.
              Finally, use the global gamma_aware_bilinear boolean if you want
              to statically branch based on whether bilinear filtering is
              gamma-correct or not (e.g. for placing Gaussian blur samples).

  Detailed Policy:
  tex*D*_linearize() functions enforce a consistent gamma-management policy
  based on the FIRST_PASS and GAMMA_ENCODE_EVERY_FBO settings.  They assume
  their input texture has the same encoding characteristics as the input for
  the current pass (which doesn't apply to the exceptions listed above).
  Similarly, encode_output() enforces a policy based on the LAST_PASS and
  GAMMA_ENCODE_EVERY_FBO settings.  Together, they result in one of the
  following two pipelines.
  Typical pipeline with intermediate sRGB framebuffers:
      linear_color = pow(pass0_encoded_color, input_gamma);
      intermediate_output = linear_color;     //  Automatic sRGB encoding
      linear_color = intermediate_output;     //  Automatic sRGB decoding
      final_output = pow(intermediate_output, 1.0/output_gamma);
  Typical pipeline without intermediate sRGB framebuffers:
      linear_color = pow(pass0_encoded_color, input_gamma);
      intermediate_output = pow(linear_color, 1.0/intermediate_gamma);
      linear_color = pow(intermediate_output, intermediate_gamma);
      final_output = pow(intermediate_output, 1.0/output_gamma);
  Using GAMMA_ENCODE_EVERY_FBO is much slower, but it's provided as a way to
  easily get gamma-correctness without banding on devices where sRGB isn't
  supported.

  Use This Header to Maximize Code Reuse:
  The purpose of this header is to provide a consistent interface for texture
  reads and output gamma-encoding that localizes and abstracts away all the
  annoying details.  This greatly reduces the amount of code in each shader
  pass that depends on the pass number in the .cgp preset or whether sRGB
  FBO's are being used: You can trivially change the gamma behavior of your
  whole pass by commenting or uncommenting 1-3 #defines.  To reuse the same
  code in your first, Nth, and last passes, you can even put it all in another
  header file and #include it from skeleton .cg files that #define the
  appropriate pass-specific settings.

  Rationale for Using Three Macros:
  This file uses GAMMA_ENCODE_EVERY_FBO instead of an opposite macro like
  SRGB_PIPELINE to ensure sRGB is assumed by default, which hopefully imposes
  a lower maintenance burden on each pass.  At first glance it seems we could
  accomplish everything with two macros: GAMMA_CORRECT_IN / GAMMA_CORRECT_OUT.
  This works for simple use cases where input_gamma == output_gamma, but it
  breaks down for more complex scenarios like CRT simulation, where the pass
  number determines the gamma encoding of the input and output.
/////////////////////////////  BASE CONSTANTS  ///////////////////////////////
  Set standard gamma constants, but allow users to override them:
  Standard encoding gammas:
  Typical device decoding gammas (only use for emulating devices):
  CRT/LCD reference gammas are higher than NTSC and Rec.709 video standard
  gammas: The standards purposely undercorrected for an analog CRT's
  assumed 2.5 reference display gamma to maintain contrast in assumed
  [dark] viewing conditions: http://www.poynton.com/PDFs/GammaFAQ.pdf
  These unstated assumptions about display gamma and perceptual rendering
  intent caused a lot of confusion, and more modern CRT's seemed to target
  NTSC 2.2 gamma with circuitry.  LCD displays seem to have followed suit
  (they struggle near black with 2.5 gamma anyway), especially PC/laptop
  displays designed to view sRGB in bright environments.  (Standards are
  also in flux again with BT.1886, but it's underspecified for displays.)
  Assuming alpha == 1.0 might make it easier for users to avoid some bugs,
  but only if they're aware of it.
/////////////////////  DERIVED CONSTANTS AS FUNCTIONS  ///////////////////////
  gamma-management.h should be compatible with overriding gamma values with
  runtime user parameters, but we can only define other global constants in
  terms of static constants, not uniform user parameters.  To get around this
  limitation, we need to define derived constants using functions.
  Set device gamma constants, but allow users to override them:
  The user promises to globally define the appropriate constants:
  Set decoding/encoding gammas for the first/lass passes, but allow overrides:
  The user promises to globally define the appropriate constants:
  If we gamma-correct every pass, always use ntsc_gamma between passes to
  ensure middle passes don't need to care if anything is being simulated:
  Set decoding/encoding gammas for the current pass.  Use static constants for
  linearize_input and gamma_encode_output, because they aren't derived, and
  they let the compiler do dead-code elimination.
  Users might want to know if bilinear filtering will be gamma-correct:

  "SMART" LINEARIZING TEXTURE LOOKUP FUNCTIONS:
  Provide a wide array of linearizing texture lookup wrapper functions.  The
  Cg shader spec Retroarch uses only allows for 2D textures, but 1D and 3D
  lookups are provided for completeness in case that changes someday.  Nobody
  is likely to use the *fetch and *proj functions, but they're included just
  in case.  The only tex*D texture sampling functions omitted are:
      - tex*Dcmpbias
      - tex*Dcmplod
      - tex*DARRAY*
      - tex*DMS*
      - Variants returning integers
  Standard line length restrictions are ignored below for vertical brevity.

  This is a Jinc approximation for x in [0, 45).  We'll use x in range
  [0, 4*pi) or so.  There are faster/closer approximations based on
  piecewise cubics from [0, 45) and asymptotic approximations beyond that,
  but this has a maximum absolute error < 1/512, and it's simpler/faster
  for shaders...not that it's all that useful for sparse sampling anyway.
  Requires:   1.) final_axis_impportance must be computed according to

////////////////////////////////  INCLUDES  //////////////////////////////////
///////////////////////////  DRIVER CAPABILITIES  ////////////////////////////
  The Cg compiler uses different "profiles" with different capabilities.
  This shader requires a Cg compilation profile >= arbfp1, but a few options
  require higher profiles like fp30 or fp40.  The shader can't detect profile
  or driver capabilities, so instead you must comment or uncomment the lines
  below with "//" before "#define."  Disable an option if you get compilation
  errors resembling those listed.  Generally speaking, all of these options
  will run on nVidia cards, but only DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DBIAS (if that) is
  likely to run on ATI/AMD, due to the Cg compiler's profile limitations.
  Derivatives: Unsupported on fp20, ps_1_1, ps_1_2, ps_1_3, and arbfp1.
  Among other things, derivatives help us fix anisotropic filtering artifacts
  with curved manually tiled phosphor mask coords.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float2 ddx(float2);" not supported in this profile
  error C3004: function "float2 ddy(float2);" not supported in this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_DERIVATIVES
  Fine derivatives: Unsupported on older ATI cards.
  Fine derivatives enable 2x2 fragment block communication, letting us perform
  fast single-pass blur operations.  If your card uses coarse derivatives and
  these are enabled, blurs could look broken.  Derivatives are a prerequisite.
  Dynamic looping: Requires an fp30 or newer profile.
  This makes phosphor mask resampling faster in some cases.  Related errors:
  error C5013: profile does not support "for" statements and "for" could not
  be unrolled
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_BRANCHES
  Without DRIVERS_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_BRANCHES, we need to use unrollable loops.
  Using one static loop avoids overhead if the user is right, but if the user
  is wrong (loops are allowed), breaking a loop into if-blocked pieces with a
  binary search can potentially save some iterations.  However, it may fail:
  error C6001: Temporary register limit of 32 exceeded; 35 registers
  needed to compile program
#define ACCOMODATE_POSSIBLE_DYNAMIC_LOOPS
  tex2Dlod: Requires an fp40 or newer profile.  This can be used to disable
  anisotropic filtering, thereby fixing related artifacts.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float4 tex2Dlod(sampler2D, float4);" not supported in
  this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DLOD
  tex2Dbias: Requires an fp30 or newer profile.  This can be used to alleviate
  artifacts from anisotropic filtering and mipmapping.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float4 tex2Dbias(sampler2D, float4);" not supported
  in this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DBIAS
  Integrated graphics compatibility: Integrated graphics like Intel HD 4000
  impose stricter limitations on register counts and instructions.  Enable
  INTEGRATED_GRAPHICS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE if you still see error C6001 or:
  error C6002: Instruction limit of 1024 exceeded: 1523 instructions needed
  to compile program.
  Enabling integrated graphics compatibility mode will automatically disable:
  1.) PHOSPHOR_MASK_MANUALLY_RESIZE: The phosphor mask will be softer.
      (This may be reenabled in a later release.)
  2.) RUNTIME_GEOMETRY_MODE
  3.) The high-quality 4x4 Gaussian resize for the bloom approximation
#define INTEGRATED_GRAPHICS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE
//////////////////////////  USER CODEPATH OPTIONS  ///////////////////////////
  To disable a #define option, turn its line into a comment with "//.
  RUNTIME VS. COMPILE-TIME OPTIONS (Major Performance Implications):
  Enable runtime shader parameters in the Retroarch (etc.) GUI?  They override
  many of the options in this file and allow real-time tuning, but many of
  them are slower.  Disabling them and using this text file will boost FPS.
  Specify the phosphor bloom sigma at runtime?  This option is 10% slower, but
  it's the only way to do a wide-enough full bloom with a runtime dot pitch.
  Specify antialiasing weight parameters at runtime?  (Costs ~20% with cubics)
  Specify subpixel offsets at runtime? (WARNING: EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE!)
#define RUNTIME_ANTIALIAS_SUBPIXEL_OFFSETS
  Make beam_horiz_filter and beam_horiz_linear_rgb_weight into runtime shader
  parameters?  This will require more math or dynamic branching.
  Specify the tilt at runtime?  This makes things about 3% slower.
  Specify the geometry mode at runtime?
  Specify the phosphor mask type (aperture grille, slot mask, shadow mask) and
  mode (Lanczos-resize, hardware resize, or tile 1:1) at runtime, even without
  dynamic branches?  This is cheap if mask_resize_viewport_scale is small.
  PHOSPHOR MASK:
  Manually resize the phosphor mask for best results (slower)?  Disabling this
  removes the option to do so, but it may be faster without dynamic branches.
  If we sinc-resize the mask, should we Lanczos-window it (slower but better)?
  Larger blurs are expensive, but we need them to blur larger triads.  We can
  detect the right blur if the triad size is static or our profile allows
  dynamic branches, but otherwise we use the largest blur the user indicates
  they might need:
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_6_PIXELS
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_9_PIXELS
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_12_PIXELS
  Here's a helpful chart:

/////////////////////////////  USER PARAMETERS  //////////////////////////////
  Note: Many of these static parameters are overridden by runtime shader
  parameters when those are enabled.  However, many others are static codepath
  options that were cleaner or more convert to code as static constants.
  GAMMA:
  LEVELS MANAGEMENT:
  Control the final multiplicative image contrast:
  We auto-dim to avoid clipping between passes and restore brightness
  later.  Control the dim factor here: Lower values clip less but crush
  blacks more (static only for now).
  HALATION/DIFFUSION/BLOOM:
  Halation weight: How much energy should be lost to electrons bounding
  around under the CRT glass and exciting random phosphors?
  Refractive diffusion weight: How much light should spread/diffuse from
  refracting through the CRT glass?
  Underestimate brightness: Bright areas bloom more, but we can base the
  bloom brightpass on a lower brightness to sharpen phosphors, or a higher
  brightness to soften them.  Low values clip, but >= 0.8 looks okay.
  Blur all colors more than necessary for a softer phosphor bloom?
  The BLOOM_APPROX pass approximates a phosphor blur early on with a small
  blurred resize of the input (convergence offsets are applied as well).
  There are three filter options (static option only for now):
  0.) Bilinear resize: A fast, close approximation to a 4x4 resize
      if min_allowed_viewport_triads and the BLOOM_APPROX resolution are sane
      and beam_max_sigma is low.
  1.) 3x3 resize blur: Medium speed, soft/smeared from bilinear blurring,
      always uses a static sigma regardless of beam_max_sigma or
      mask_num_triads_desired.
  2.) True 4x4 Gaussian resize: Slowest, technically correct.
  These options are more pronounced for the fast, unbloomed shader version.
  ELECTRON BEAM SCANLINE DISTRIBUTION:
  How many scanlines should contribute light to each pixel?  Using more
  scanlines is slower (especially for a generalized Gaussian) but less
  distorted with larger beam sigmas (especially for a pure Gaussian).  The
  max_beam_sigma at which the closest unused weight is guaranteed <
  1.0/255.0 (for a 3x antialiased pure Gaussian) is:
      2 scanlines: max_beam_sigma = 0.2089; distortions begin ~0.34; 141.7 FPS pure, 131.9 FPS generalized
      3 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.3879; distortions begin ~0.52; 137.5 FPS pure; 123.8 FPS generalized
      4 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.5723; distortions begin ~0.70; 134.7 FPS pure; 117.2 FPS generalized
      5 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.7591; distortions begin ~0.89; 131.6 FPS pure; 112.1 FPS generalized
      6 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.9483; distortions begin ~1.08; 127.9 FPS pure; 105.6 FPS generalized
  A generalized Gaussian beam varies shape with color too, now just width.
  It's slower but more flexible (static option only for now).
  What kind of scanline antialiasing do you want?
  0: Sample weights at 1x; 1: Sample weights at 3x; 2: Compute an integral
  Integrals are slow (especially for generalized Gaussians) and rarely any
  better than 3x antialiasing (static option only for now).
  Min/max standard deviations for scanline beams: Higher values widen and
  soften scanlines.  Depending on other options, low min sigmas can alias.
  Beam width varies as a function of color: A power function (0) is more
  configurable, but a spherical function (1) gives the widest beam
  variability without aliasing (static option only for now).
  Spot shape power: Powers <= 1 give smoother spot shapes but lower
  sharpness.  Powers >= 1.0 are awful unless mix/max sigmas are close.
  Generalized Gaussian max shape parameters: Higher values give flatter
  scanline plateaus and steeper dropoffs, simultaneously widening and
  sharpening scanlines at the cost of aliasing.  2.0 is pure Gaussian, and
  values > ~40.0 cause artifacts with integrals.
  Generalized Gaussian shape power: Affects how quickly the distribution
  changes shape from Gaussian to steep/plateaued as color increases from 0
  to 1.0.  Higher powers appear softer for most colors, and lower powers
  appear sharper for most colors.
  What filter should be used to sample scanlines horizontally?
  0: Quilez (fast), 1: Gaussian (configurable), 2: Lanczos2 (sharp)
  Standard deviation for horizontal Gaussian resampling:
  Do horizontal scanline sampling in linear RGB (correct light mixing),
  gamma-encoded RGB (darker, hard spot shape, may better match bandwidth-
  limiting circuitry in some CRT's), or a weighted avg.?
  Simulate scanline misconvergence?  This needs 3x horizontal texture
  samples and 3x texture samples of BLOOM_APPROX and HALATION_BLUR in
  later passes (static option only for now).
  Convergence offsets in x/y directions for R/G/B scanline beams in units
  of scanlines.  Positive offsets go right/down; ranges [-2, 2]
  Detect interlacing (static option only for now)?
  Assume 1080-line sources are interlaced?
  For interlaced sources, assume TFF (top-field first) or BFF order?
  (Whether this matters depends on the nature of the interlaced input.)
  ANTIALIASING:
  What AA level do you want for curvature/overscan/subpixels?  Options:
  0x (none), 1x (sample subpixels), 4x, 5x, 6x, 7x, 8x, 12x, 16x, 20x, 24x
  (Static option only for now)
  What antialiasing filter do you want (static option only)?  Options:
  0: Box (separable), 1: Box (cylindrical),
  2: Tent (separable), 3: Tent (cylindrical),
  4: Gaussian (separable), 5: Gaussian (cylindrical),
  6: Cubic* (separable), 7: Cubic* (cylindrical, poor)
  8: Lanczos Sinc (separable), 9: Lanczos Jinc (cylindrical, poor)
      * = Especially slow with RUNTIME_ANTIALIAS_WEIGHTS
  Flip the sample grid on odd/even frames (static option only for now)?
  Use RGB subpixel offsets for antialiasing?  The pixel is at green, and
  the blue offset is the negative r offset; range [0, 0.5]
  Cubics: See http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/filter/#mitchell
  1.) "Keys cubics" with B = 1 - 2C are considered the highest quality.
  2.) C = 0.5 (default) is Catmull-Rom; higher C's apply sharpening.
  3.) C = 1.0/3.0 is the Mitchell-Netravali filter.
  4.) C = 0.0 is a soft spline filter.
  Standard deviation for Gaussian antialiasing: Try 0.5/aa_pixel_diameter.
  PHOSPHOR MASK:
  Mask type: 0 = aperture grille, 1 = slot mask, 2 = EDP shadow mask
  We can sample the mask three ways.  Pick 2/3 from: Pretty/Fast/Flexible.
  0.) Sinc-resize to the desired dot pitch manually (pretty/slow/flexible).
      This requires PHOSPHOR_MASK_MANUALLY_RESIZE to be #defined.
  1.) Hardware-resize to the desired dot pitch (ugly/fast/flexible).  This
      is halfway decent with LUT mipmapping but atrocious without it.
  2.) Tile it without resizing at a 1:1 texel:pixel ratio for flat coords
      (pretty/fast/inflexible).  Each input LUT has a fixed dot pitch.
      This mode reuses the same masks, so triads will be enormous unless
      you change the mask LUT filenames in your .cgp file.
  Prefer setting the triad size (0.0) or number on the screen (1.0)?
  If RUNTIME_PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_SIGMA isn't #defined, the specified triad size
  will always be used to calculate the full bloom sigma statically.
  Specify the phosphor triad size, in pixels.  Each tile (usually with 8
  triads) will be rounded to the nearest integer tile size and clamped to
  obey minimum size constraints (imposed to reduce downsize taps) and
  maximum size constraints (imposed to have a sane MASK_RESIZE FBO size).
  To increase the size limit, double the viewport-relative scales for the
  two MASK_RESIZE passes in crt-royale.cgp and user-cgp-contants.h.
      range [1, mask_texture_small_size/mask_triads_per_tile]
  If mask_specify_num_triads is 1.0/true, we'll go by this instead (the
  final size will be rounded and constrained as above); default 480.0
  How many lobes should the sinc/Lanczos resizer use?  More lobes require
  more samples and avoid moire a bit better, but some is unavoidable
  depending on the destination size (static option for now).
  The mask is resized using a variable number of taps in each dimension,
  but some Cg profiles always fetch a constant number of taps no matter
  what (no dynamic branching).  We can limit the maximum number of taps if
  we statically limit the minimum phosphor triad size.  Larger values are
  faster, but the limit IS enforced (static option only, forever);
      range [1, mask_texture_small_size/mask_triads_per_tile]
  TODO: Make this 1.0 and compensate with smarter sampling!
  GEOMETRY:

  2: Alt. spherical mapping (more bulbous), 3: Cylindrical/Trinitron
  Radius of curvature: Measured in units of your viewport's diagonal size.
  View dist is the distance from the player to their physical screen, in
  units of the viewport's diagonal size.  It controls the field of view.
  Tilt angle in radians (clockwise around up and right vectors):
  Aspect ratio: When the true viewport size is unknown, this value is used
  to help convert between the phosphor triad size and count, along with
  the mask_resize_viewport_scale constant from user-cgp-constants.h.  Set
  this equal to Retroarch's display aspect ratio (DAR) for best results;
  range [1, geom_max_aspect_ratio from user-cgp-constants.h];
  default (256/224)*(54/47) = 1.313069909 (see below)
  Before getting into overscan, here's some general aspect ratio info:
  - DAR = display aspect ratio = SAR * PAR; as in your Retroarch setting
  - SAR = storage aspect ratio = DAR / PAR; square pixel emulator frame AR
  - PAR = pixel aspect ratio   = DAR / SAR; holds regardless of cropping
  Geometry processing has to "undo" the screen-space 2D DAR to calculate
  3D view vectors, then reapplies the aspect ratio to the simulated CRT in
  uv-space.  To ensure the source SAR is intended for a ~4:3 DAR, either:
  a.) Enable Retroarch's "Crop Overscan
  b.) Readd horizontal padding: Set overscan to e.g. N*(1.0, 240.0/224.0)
  Real consoles use horizontal black padding in the signal, but emulators
  often crop this without cropping the vertical padding; a 256x224 [S]NES
  frame (8:7 SAR) is intended for a ~4:3 DAR, but a 256x240 frame is not.
  The correct [S]NES PAR is 54:47, found by blargg and NewRisingSun:
      http://board.zsnes.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=11928&start=50
      http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=24815#p24815
  For flat output, it's okay to set DAR = [existing] SAR * [correct] PAR
  without doing a. or b., but horizontal image borders will be tighter
  than vertical ones, messing up curvature and overscan.  Fixing the
  padding first corrects this.
  Overscan: Amount to "zoom in" before cropping.  You can zoom uniformly
  or adjust x/y independently to e.g. readd horizontal padding, as noted
  above: Values < 1.0 zoom out; range (0, inf)
  Compute a proper pixel-space to texture-space matrix even without ddx()/
  ddy()?  This is ~8.5% slower but improves antialiasing/subpixel filtering
  with strong curvature (static option only for now).
  BORDERS:
  Rounded border size in texture uv coords:
  Border darkness: Moderate values darken the border smoothly, and high
  values make the image very dark just inside the border:
  Border compression: High numbers compress border transitions, narrowing
  the dark border area.

///////////////////////////////  DESCRIPTION  ////////////////////////////////
  These macros and constants can be used across the whole codebase.
  Unlike the values in user-settings.cgh, end users shouldn't modify these.
////////////////////////////////  INCLUDES  //////////////////////////////////
///////////////////////////  DRIVER CAPABILITIES  ////////////////////////////
  The Cg compiler uses different "profiles" with different capabilities.
  This shader requires a Cg compilation profile >= arbfp1, but a few options
  require higher profiles like fp30 or fp40.  The shader can't detect profile
  or driver capabilities, so instead you must comment or uncomment the lines
  below with "//" before "#define."  Disable an option if you get compilation
  errors resembling those listed.  Generally speaking, all of these options
  will run on nVidia cards, but only DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DBIAS (if that) is
  likely to run on ATI/AMD, due to the Cg compiler's profile limitations.
  Derivatives: Unsupported on fp20, ps_1_1, ps_1_2, ps_1_3, and arbfp1.
  Among other things, derivatives help us fix anisotropic filtering artifacts
  with curved manually tiled phosphor mask coords.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float2 ddx(float2);" not supported in this profile
  error C3004: function "float2 ddy(float2);" not supported in this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_DERIVATIVES
  Fine derivatives: Unsupported on older ATI cards.
  Fine derivatives enable 2x2 fragment block communication, letting us perform
  fast single-pass blur operations.  If your card uses coarse derivatives and
  these are enabled, blurs could look broken.  Derivatives are a prerequisite.
  Dynamic looping: Requires an fp30 or newer profile.
  This makes phosphor mask resampling faster in some cases.  Related errors:
  error C5013: profile does not support "for" statements and "for" could not
  be unrolled
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_BRANCHES
  Without DRIVERS_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_BRANCHES, we need to use unrollable loops.
  Using one static loop avoids overhead if the user is right, but if the user
  is wrong (loops are allowed), breaking a loop into if-blocked pieces with a
  binary search can potentially save some iterations.  However, it may fail:
  error C6001: Temporary register limit of 32 exceeded; 35 registers
  needed to compile program
#define ACCOMODATE_POSSIBLE_DYNAMIC_LOOPS
  tex2Dlod: Requires an fp40 or newer profile.  This can be used to disable
  anisotropic filtering, thereby fixing related artifacts.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float4 tex2Dlod(sampler2D, float4);" not supported in
  this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DLOD
  tex2Dbias: Requires an fp30 or newer profile.  This can be used to alleviate
  artifacts from anisotropic filtering and mipmapping.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float4 tex2Dbias(sampler2D, float4);" not supported
  in this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DBIAS
  Integrated graphics compatibility: Integrated graphics like Intel HD 4000
  impose stricter limitations on register counts and instructions.  Enable
  INTEGRATED_GRAPHICS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE if you still see error C6001 or:
  error C6002: Instruction limit of 1024 exceeded: 1523 instructions needed
  to compile program.
  Enabling integrated graphics compatibility mode will automatically disable:
  1.) PHOSPHOR_MASK_MANUALLY_RESIZE: The phosphor mask will be softer.
      (This may be reenabled in a later release.)
  2.) RUNTIME_GEOMETRY_MODE
  3.) The high-quality 4x4 Gaussian resize for the bloom approximation
#define INTEGRATED_GRAPHICS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE
//////////////////////////  USER CODEPATH OPTIONS  ///////////////////////////
  To disable a #define option, turn its line into a comment with "//.
  RUNTIME VS. COMPILE-TIME OPTIONS (Major Performance Implications):
  Enable runtime shader parameters in the Retroarch (etc.) GUI?  They override
  many of the options in this file and allow real-time tuning, but many of
  them are slower.  Disabling them and using this text file will boost FPS.
  Specify the phosphor bloom sigma at runtime?  This option is 10% slower, but
  it's the only way to do a wide-enough full bloom with a runtime dot pitch.
  Specify antialiasing weight parameters at runtime?  (Costs ~20% with cubics)
  Specify subpixel offsets at runtime? (WARNING: EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE!)
#define RUNTIME_ANTIALIAS_SUBPIXEL_OFFSETS
  Make beam_horiz_filter and beam_horiz_linear_rgb_weight into runtime shader
  parameters?  This will require more math or dynamic branching.
  Specify the tilt at runtime?  This makes things about 3% slower.
  Specify the geometry mode at runtime?
  Specify the phosphor mask type (aperture grille, slot mask, shadow mask) and
  mode (Lanczos-resize, hardware resize, or tile 1:1) at runtime, even without
  dynamic branches?  This is cheap if mask_resize_viewport_scale is small.
  PHOSPHOR MASK:
  Manually resize the phosphor mask for best results (slower)?  Disabling this
  removes the option to do so, but it may be faster without dynamic branches.
  If we sinc-resize the mask, should we Lanczos-window it (slower but better)?
  Larger blurs are expensive, but we need them to blur larger triads.  We can
  detect the right blur if the triad size is static or our profile allows
  dynamic branches, but otherwise we use the largest blur the user indicates
  they might need:
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_6_PIXELS
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_9_PIXELS
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_12_PIXELS
  Here's a helpful chart:
  MaxTriadSize    BlurSize    MinTriadCountsByResolution
  3.0             9.0         480/640/960/1920 triads at 1080p/1440p/2160p/4320p, 4:3 aspect

/////////////////////////////  USER PARAMETERS  //////////////////////////////
  Note: Many of these static parameters are overridden by runtime shader
  parameters when those are enabled.  However, many others are static codepath
  options that were cleaner or more convert to code as static constants.
  GAMMA:
  LEVELS MANAGEMENT:
  Control the final multiplicative image contrast:
  We auto-dim to avoid clipping between passes and restore brightness
  later.  Control the dim factor here: Lower values clip less but crush
  blacks more (static only for now).
  HALATION/DIFFUSION/BLOOM:
  Halation weight: How much energy should be lost to electrons bounding
  around under the CRT glass and exciting random phosphors?
  Refractive diffusion weight: How much light should spread/diffuse from
  refracting through the CRT glass?
  Underestimate brightness: Bright areas bloom more, but we can base the
  bloom brightpass on a lower brightness to sharpen phosphors, or a higher
  brightness to soften them.  Low values clip, but >= 0.8 looks okay.
  Blur all colors more than necessary for a softer phosphor bloom?
  The BLOOM_APPROX pass approximates a phosphor blur early on with a small
  blurred resize of the input (convergence offsets are applied as well).
  There are three filter options (static option only for now):
  0.) Bilinear resize: A fast, close approximation to a 4x4 resize
      if min_allowed_viewport_triads and the BLOOM_APPROX resolution are sane
      and beam_max_sigma is low.
  1.) 3x3 resize blur: Medium speed, soft/smeared from bilinear blurring,
      always uses a static sigma regardless of beam_max_sigma or
      mask_num_triads_desired.
  2.) True 4x4 Gaussian resize: Slowest, technically correct.
  These options are more pronounced for the fast, unbloomed shader version.
  ELECTRON BEAM SCANLINE DISTRIBUTION:
  How many scanlines should contribute light to each pixel?  Using more
  scanlines is slower (especially for a generalized Gaussian) but less
  distorted with larger beam sigmas (especially for a pure Gaussian).  The
  max_beam_sigma at which the closest unused weight is guaranteed <
  1.0/255.0 (for a 3x antialiased pure Gaussian) is:
      2 scanlines: max_beam_sigma = 0.2089; distortions begin ~0.34; 141.7 FPS pure, 131.9 FPS generalized
      3 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.3879; distortions begin ~0.52; 137.5 FPS pure; 123.8 FPS generalized
      4 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.5723; distortions begin ~0.70; 134.7 FPS pure; 117.2 FPS generalized
      5 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.7591; distortions begin ~0.89; 131.6 FPS pure; 112.1 FPS generalized
      6 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.9483; distortions begin ~1.08; 127.9 FPS pure; 105.6 FPS generalized
  A generalized Gaussian beam varies shape with color too, now just width.
  It's slower but more flexible (static option only for now).
  What kind of scanline antialiasing do you want?
  0: Sample weights at 1x; 1: Sample weights at 3x; 2: Compute an integral
  Integrals are slow (especially for generalized Gaussians) and rarely any
  better than 3x antialiasing (static option only for now).
  Min/max standard deviations for scanline beams: Higher values widen and
  soften scanlines.  Depending on other options, low min sigmas can alias.
  Beam width varies as a function of color: A power function (0) is more
  configurable, but a spherical function (1) gives the widest beam
  variability without aliasing (static option only for now).
  Spot shape power: Powers <= 1 give smoother spot shapes but lower
  sharpness.  Powers >= 1.0 are awful unless mix/max sigmas are close.
  Generalized Gaussian max shape parameters: Higher values give flatter
  scanline plateaus and steeper dropoffs, simultaneously widening and
  sharpening scanlines at the cost of aliasing.  2.0 is pure Gaussian, and
  values > ~40.0 cause artifacts with integrals.
  Generalized Gaussian shape power: Affects how quickly the distribution
  changes shape from Gaussian to steep/plateaued as color increases from 0
  to 1.0.  Higher powers appear softer for most colors, and lower powers
  appear sharper for most colors.
  What filter should be used to sample scanlines horizontally?
  0: Quilez (fast), 1: Gaussian (configurable), 2: Lanczos2 (sharp)
  Standard deviation for horizontal Gaussian resampling:
  Do horizontal scanline sampling in linear RGB (correct light mixing),
  gamma-encoded RGB (darker, hard spot shape, may better match bandwidth-
  limiting circuitry in some CRT's), or a weighted avg.?
  Simulate scanline misconvergence?  This needs 3x horizontal texture
  samples and 3x texture samples of BLOOM_APPROX and HALATION_BLUR in
  later passes (static option only for now).
  Convergence offsets in x/y directions for R/G/B scanline beams in units
  of scanlines.  Positive offsets go right/down; ranges [-2, 2]
  Detect interlacing (static option only for now)?
  Assume 1080-line sources are interlaced?
  For interlaced sources, assume TFF (top-field first) or BFF order?
  (Whether this matters depends on the nature of the interlaced input.)
  ANTIALIASING:
  What AA level do you want for curvature/overscan/subpixels?  Options:
  0x (none), 1x (sample subpixels), 4x, 5x, 6x, 7x, 8x, 12x, 16x, 20x, 24x

  What antialiasing filter do you want (static option only)?  Options:

  6: Cubic* (separable), 7: Cubic* (cylindrical, poor)

      range [1, mask_texture_small_size/mask_triads_per_tile]
  If mask_specify_num_triads is 1.0/true, we'll go by this instead (the

  Compute a proper pixel-space to texture-space matrix even without ddx()/
  ddy()?  This is ~8.5% slower but improves antialiasing/subpixel filtering
  with strong curvature (static option only for now).
  BORDERS:
  Rounded border size in texture uv coords:
  Border darkness: Moderate values darken the border smoothly, and high
  values make the image very dark just inside the border:
  Border compression: High numbers compress border transitions, narrowing
  the dark border area.
  IMPORTANT:
  These constants MUST be set appropriately for the settings in crt-royale.cgp
  (or whatever related .cgp file you're using).  If they aren't, you're likely
  to get artifacts, the wrong phosphor mask size, etc.  I wish these could be
  set directly in the .cgp file to make things easier, but...they can't.
  PASS SCALES AND RELATED CONSTANTS:
  Copy the absolute scale_x for BLOOM_APPROX.  There are two major versions of
  this shader: One does a viewport-scale bloom, and the other skips it.  The
  latter benefits from a higher bloom_approx_scale_x, so save both separately:
  Copy the viewport-relative scales of the phosphor mask resize passes
  (MASK_RESIZE and the pass immediately preceding it):
  Copy the geom_max_aspect_ratio used to calculate the MASK_RESIZE scales, etc.:
  PHOSPHOR MASK TEXTURE CONSTANTS:
  Set the following constants to reflect the properties of the phosphor mask
  texture named in crt-royale.cgp.  The shader optionally resizes a mask tile
  based on user settings, then repeats a single tile until filling the screen.
  The shader must know the input texture size (default 64x64), and to manually
  resize, it must also know the horizontal triads per tile (default 8).
  We need the average brightness of the phosphor mask to compensate for the
  dimming it causes.  The following four values are roughly correct for the
  masks included with the shader.  Update the value for any LUT texture you
  change.  [Un]comment "#define PHOSPHOR_MASK_GRILLE14" depending on whether
  the loaded aperture grille uses 14-pixel or 15-pixel stripes (default 15).

/////////////////////////////  FIXED SETTINGS  ///////////////////////////////
  Avoid dividing by zero; using a macro overloads for float, float2, etc.:
  Ensure the first pass decodes CRT gamma and the last encodes LCD gamma.
  Manually tiling a manually resized texture creates texture coord derivative
  discontinuities and confuses anisotropic filtering, causing discolored tile
  seams in the phosphor mask.  Workarounds:
  a.) Using tex2Dlod disables anisotropic filtering for tiled masks.  It's
      downgraded to tex2Dbias without DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DLOD #defined and
      disabled without DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DBIAS #defined either.
  b.) "Tile flat twice" requires drawing two full tiles without border padding
      to the resized mask FBO, and it's incompatible with same-pass curvature.
      (Same-pass curvature isn't used but could be in the future...maybe.)
  c.) "Fix discontinuities" requires derivatives and drawing one tile with
      border padding to the resized mask FBO, but it works with same-pass
      curvature.  It's disabled without DRIVERS_ALLOW_DERIVATIVES #defined.
  Precedence: a, then, b, then c (if multiple strategies are #defined).
  Also, manually resampling the phosphor mask is slightly blurrier with
  anisotropic filtering.  (Resampling with mipmapping is even worse: It
  creates artifacts, but only with the fully bloomed shader.)  The difference
  is subtle with small triads, but you can fix it for a small cost.
#define ANISOTROPIC_RESAMPLING_COMPAT_TEX2DLOD
////////////////////////////  DERIVED SETTINGS  //////////////////////////////
  Intel HD 4000 GPU's can't handle manual mask resizing (for now), setting the
  geometry mode at runtime, or a 4x4 true Gaussian resize.  Disable
  incompatible settings ASAP.  (INTEGRATED_GRAPHICS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE may be
  #defined by either user-settings.h or a wrapper .cg that #includes the
  current .cg pass.)
  Mode 2 (4x4 Gaussian resize) won't work, and mode 1 (3x3 blur) is
  inferior in most cases, so replace 2.0 with 0.0:
  Disable slow runtime paths if static parameters are used.  Most of these
  won't be a problem anyway once the params are disabled, but some will.
  Make tex2Dbias a backup for tex2Dlod for wider compatibility.
  Rule out unavailable anisotropic compatibility strategies:
  Prioritize anisotropic tiling compatibility strategies by performance and
  disable unused strategies.  This concentrates all the nesting in one place.
  ANISOTROPIC_TILING_COMPAT_TILE_FLAT_TWICE is only compatible with
  flat texture coords in the same pass, but that's all we use.
  The tex2Dlod and tex2Dbias strategies share a lot in common, and we can
  reduce some #ifdef nesting in the next section by essentially OR'ing them:
  Prioritize anisotropic resampling compatibility strategies the same way:
/////////////////////  DERIVED PHOSPHOR MASK CONSTANTS  //////////////////////
  If we can use the large mipmapped LUT without mipmapping artifacts, we
  should: It gives us more options for using fewer samples.
  TODO: Take advantage of this!
  tex2D's sampler2D parameter MUST be a uniform global, a uniform input to
  main_fragment, or a static alias of one of the above.  This makes it hard
  to select the phosphor mask at runtime: We can't even assign to a uniform
  global in the vertex shader or select a sampler2D in the vertex shader and
  pass it to the fragment shader (even with explicit TEXUNIT# bindings),
  because it just gives us the input texture or a black screen.  However, we
  can get around these limitations by calling tex2D three times with different
  uniform samplers (or resizing the phosphor mask three times altogether).
  With dynamic branches, we can process only one of these branches on top of
  quickly discarding fragments we don't need (cgc seems able to overcome
  limigations around dependent texture fetches inside of branches).  Without
  dynamic branches, we have to process every branch for every fragment...which
  is slower.  Runtime sampling mode selection is slower without dynamic
  branches as well.  Let the user's static #defines decide if it's worth it.
  We need to render some minimum number of tiles in the resize passes.
  We need at least 1.0 just to repeat a single tile, and we need extra
  padding beyond that for anisotropic filtering, discontinuitity fixing,
  antialiasing, same-pass curvature (not currently used), etc.  First
  determine how many border texels and tiles we need, based on how the result
  will be sampled:
  Most antialiasing filters have a base radius of 4.0 pixels:
  Anisotropic filtering adds about 0.5 to the pixel border:
  Fixing discontinuities adds 1.0 more to the pixel border:
  Convert the pixel border to an integer texel border.  Assume same-pass
  curvature about triples the texel frequency:
  Convert the texel border to a tile border using worst-case assumptions:
  Finally, set the number of resized tiles to render to MASK_RESIZE, and set
  the starting texel (inside borders) for sampling it.
  Special case: Render two tiles without borders.  Anisotropic
  filtering doesn't seem to be a problem here.
  We have to fit mask_resize_num_tiles into an FBO with a viewport scale of
  mask_resize_viewport_scale.  This limits the maximum final triad size.
  Estimate the minimum number of triads we can split the screen into in each
  dimension (we'll be as correct as mask_resize_viewport_scale is):
//////////////////////  COMMON MATHEMATICAL CONSTANTS  ///////////////////////
  We often want to find the location of the previous texel, e.g.:
      const float2 curr_texel = uv * texture_size;
      const float2 prev_texel = floor(curr_texel - float2(0.5)) + float2(0.5);
      const float2 prev_texel_uv = prev_texel / texture_size;
  However, many GPU drivers round incorrectly around exact texel locations.
  We need to subtract a little less than 0.5 before flooring, and some GPU's
  require this value to be farther from 0.5 than others; define it here.
      const float2 prev_texel =
          floor(curr_texel - float2(under_half)) + float2(0.5);

///////////////////////////  SETTINGS MANAGEMENT  ////////////////////////////
///////////////////////////  DRIVER CAPABILITIES  ////////////////////////////
  The Cg compiler uses different "profiles" with different capabilities.
  This shader requires a Cg compilation profile >= arbfp1, but a few options
  require higher profiles like fp30 or fp40.  The shader can't detect profile
  or driver capabilities, so instead you must comment or uncomment the lines
  below with "//" before "#define."  Disable an option if you get compilation
  errors resembling those listed.  Generally speaking, all of these options
  will run on nVidia cards, but only DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DBIAS (if that) is
  likely to run on ATI/AMD, due to the Cg compiler's profile limitations.
  Derivatives: Unsupported on fp20, ps_1_1, ps_1_2, ps_1_3, and arbfp1.
  Among other things, derivatives help us fix anisotropic filtering artifacts
  with curved manually tiled phosphor mask coords.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float2 ddx(float2);" not supported in this profile
  error C3004: function "float2 ddy(float2);" not supported in this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_DERIVATIVES
  Fine derivatives: Unsupported on older ATI cards.
  Fine derivatives enable 2x2 fragment block communication, letting us perform
  fast single-pass blur operations.  If your card uses coarse derivatives and
  these are enabled, blurs could look broken.  Derivatives are a prerequisite.
  Dynamic looping: Requires an fp30 or newer profile.
  This makes phosphor mask resampling faster in some cases.  Related errors:
  error C5013: profile does not support "for" statements and "for" could not
  be unrolled
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_BRANCHES
  Without DRIVERS_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_BRANCHES, we need to use unrollable loops.
  Using one static loop avoids overhead if the user is right, but if the user
  is wrong (loops are allowed), breaking a loop into if-blocked pieces with a
  binary search can potentially save some iterations.  However, it may fail:
  error C6001: Temporary register limit of 32 exceeded; 35 registers
  needed to compile program
#define ACCOMODATE_POSSIBLE_DYNAMIC_LOOPS
  tex2Dlod: Requires an fp40 or newer profile.  This can be used to disable
  anisotropic filtering, thereby fixing related artifacts.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float4 tex2Dlod(sampler2D, float4);" not supported in
  this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DLOD
  tex2Dbias: Requires an fp30 or newer profile.  This can be used to alleviate
  artifacts from anisotropic filtering and mipmapping.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float4 tex2Dbias(sampler2D, float4);" not supported
  in this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DBIAS
  Integrated graphics compatibility: Integrated graphics like Intel HD 4000
  impose stricter limitations on register counts and instructions.  Enable
  INTEGRATED_GRAPHICS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE if you still see error C6001 or:
  error C6002: Instruction limit of 1024 exceeded: 1523 instructions needed
  to compile program.
  Enabling integrated graphics compatibility mode will automatically disable:
  1.) PHOSPHOR_MASK_MANUALLY_RESIZE: The phosphor mask will be softer.
      (This may be reenabled in a later release.)
  2.) RUNTIME_GEOMETRY_MODE
  3.) The high-quality 4x4 Gaussian resize for the bloom approximation
#define INTEGRATED_GRAPHICS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE
//////////////////////////  USER CODEPATH OPTIONS  ///////////////////////////
  To disable a #define option, turn its line into a comment with "//.
  RUNTIME VS. COMPILE-TIME OPTIONS (Major Performance Implications):
  Enable runtime shader parameters in the Retroarch (etc.) GUI?  They override
  many of the options in this file and allow real-time tuning, but many of
  them are slower.  Disabling them and using this text file will boost FPS.
  Specify the phosphor bloom sigma at runtime?  This option is 10% slower, but
  it's the only way to do a wide-enough full bloom with a runtime dot pitch.
  Specify antialiasing weight parameters at runtime?  (Costs ~20% with cubics)
  Specify subpixel offsets at runtime? (WARNING: EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE!)
#define RUNTIME_ANTIALIAS_SUBPIXEL_OFFSETS
  Make beam_horiz_filter and beam_horiz_linear_rgb_weight into runtime shader
  parameters?  This will require more math or dynamic branching.
  Specify the tilt at runtime?  This makes things about 3% slower.
  Specify the geometry mode at runtime?
  Specify the phosphor mask type (aperture grille, slot mask, shadow mask) and
  mode (Lanczos-resize, hardware resize, or tile 1:1) at runtime, even without
  dynamic branches?  This is cheap if mask_resize_viewport_scale is small.
  PHOSPHOR MASK:
  Manually resize the phosphor mask for best results (slower)?  Disabling this
  removes the option to do so, but it may be faster without dynamic branches.
  If we sinc-resize the mask, should we Lanczos-window it (slower but better)?
  Larger blurs are expensive, but we need them to blur larger triads.  We can
  detect the right blur if the triad size is static or our profile allows
  dynamic branches, but otherwise we use the largest blur the user indicates
  they might need:
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_6_PIXELS
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_9_PIXELS
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_12_PIXELS
  Here's a helpful chart:
  MaxTriadSize    BlurSize    MinTriadCountsByResolution
  3.0             9.0         480/640/960/1920 triads at 1080p/1440p/2160p/4320p, 4:3 aspect

/////////////////////////////  USER PARAMETERS  //////////////////////////////
  Note: Many of these static parameters are overridden by runtime shader
  parameters when those are enabled.  However, many others are static codepath
  options that were cleaner or more convert to code as static constants.
  GAMMA:
  LEVELS MANAGEMENT:
  Control the final multiplicative image contrast:
  We auto-dim to avoid clipping between passes and restore brightness
  later.  Control the dim factor here: Lower values clip less but crush
  blacks more (static only for now).
  HALATION/DIFFUSION/BLOOM:
  Halation weight: How much energy should be lost to electrons bounding
  around under the CRT glass and exciting random phosphors?
  Refractive diffusion weight: How much light should spread/diffuse from
  refracting through the CRT glass?
  Underestimate brightness: Bright areas bloom more, but we can base the
  bloom brightpass on a lower brightness to sharpen phosphors, or a higher
  brightness to soften them.  Low values clip, but >= 0.8 looks okay.
  Blur all colors more than necessary for a softer phosphor bloom?
  The BLOOM_APPROX pass approximates a phosphor blur early on with a small
  blurred resize of the input (convergence offsets are applied as well).
  There are three filter options (static option only for now):
  0.) Bilinear resize: A fast, close approximation to a 4x4 resize
      if min_allowed_viewport_triads and the BLOOM_APPROX resolution are sane
      and beam_max_sigma is low.
  1.) 3x3 resize blur: Medium speed, soft/smeared from bilinear blurring,
      always uses a static sigma regardless of beam_max_sigma or
      mask_num_triads_desired.
  2.) True 4x4 Gaussian resize: Slowest, technically correct.
  These options are more pronounced for the fast, unbloomed shader version.
  ELECTRON BEAM SCANLINE DISTRIBUTION:
  How many scanlines should contribute light to each pixel?  Using more
  scanlines is slower (especially for a generalized Gaussian) but less
  distorted with larger beam sigmas (especially for a pure Gaussian).  The
  max_beam_sigma at which the closest unused weight is guaranteed <
  1.0/255.0 (for a 3x antialiased pure Gaussian) is:
      2 scanlines: max_beam_sigma = 0.2089; distortions begin ~0.34; 141.7 FPS pure, 131.9 FPS generalized
      3 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.3879; distortions begin ~0.52; 137.5 FPS pure; 123.8 FPS generalized
      4 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.5723; distortions begin ~0.70; 134.7 FPS pure; 117.2 FPS generalized
      5 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.7591; distortions begin ~0.89; 131.6 FPS pure; 112.1 FPS generalized
      6 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.9483; distortions begin ~1.08; 127.9 FPS pure; 105.6 FPS generalized
  A generalized Gaussian beam varies shape with color too, now just width.
  It's slower but more flexible (static option only for now).
  What kind of scanline antialiasing do you want?
  0: Sample weights at 1x; 1: Sample weights at 3x; 2: Compute an integral
  Integrals are slow (especially for generalized Gaussians) and rarely any
  better than 3x antialiasing (static option only for now).
  Min/max standard deviations for scanline beams: Higher values widen and
  soften scanlines.  Depending on other options, low min sigmas can alias.
  Beam width varies as a function of color: A power function (0) is more
  configurable, but a spherical function (1) gives the widest beam
  variability without aliasing (static option only for now).
  Spot shape power: Powers <= 1 give smoother spot shapes but lower
  sharpness.  Powers >= 1.0 are awful unless mix/max sigmas are close.
  Generalized Gaussian max shape parameters: Higher values give flatter
  scanline plateaus and steeper dropoffs, simultaneously widening and
  sharpening scanlines at the cost of aliasing.  2.0 is pure Gaussian, and
  values > ~40.0 cause artifacts with integrals.
  Generalized Gaussian shape power: Affects how quickly the distribution
  changes shape from Gaussian to steep/plateaued as color increases from 0
  to 1.0.  Higher powers appear softer for most colors, and lower powers
  appear sharper for most colors.
  What filter should be used to sample scanlines horizontally?
  0: Quilez (fast), 1: Gaussian (configurable), 2: Lanczos2 (sharp)
  Standard deviation for horizontal Gaussian resampling:
  Do horizontal scanline sampling in linear RGB (correct light mixing),
  gamma-encoded RGB (darker, hard spot shape, may better match bandwidth-
  limiting circuitry in some CRT's), or a weighted avg.?
  Simulate scanline misconvergence?  This needs 3x horizontal texture
  samples and 3x texture samples of BLOOM_APPROX and HALATION_BLUR in
  later passes (static option only for now).
  Convergence offsets in x/y directions for R/G/B scanline beams in units
  of scanlines.  Positive offsets go right/down; ranges [-2, 2]
  Detect interlacing (static option only for now)?
  Assume 1080-line sources are interlaced?
  For interlaced sources, assume TFF (top-field first) or BFF order?
  (Whether this matters depends on the nature of the interlaced input.)
  ANTIALIASING:
  What AA level do you want for curvature/overscan/subpixels?  Options:
  0x (none), 1x (sample subpixels), 4x, 5x, 6x, 7x, 8x, 12x, 16x, 20x, 24x
  (Static option only for now)
  What antialiasing filter do you want (static option only)?  Options:
  0: Box (separable), 1: Box (cylindrical),
  2: Tent (separable), 3: Tent (cylindrical),
  4: Gaussian (separable), 5: Gaussian (cylindrical),
  6: Cubic* (separable), 7: Cubic* (cylindrical, poor)
  8: Lanczos Sinc (separable), 9: Lanczos Jinc (cylindrical, poor)
      * = Especially slow with RUNTIME_ANTIALIAS_WEIGHTS
  Flip the sample grid on odd/even frames (static option only for now)?
  Use RGB subpixel offsets for antialiasing?  The pixel is at green, and
  the blue offset is the negative r offset; range [0, 0.5]
  Cubics: See http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/filter/#mitchell
  1.) "Keys cubics" with B = 1 - 2C are considered the highest quality.
  2.) C = 0.5 (default) is Catmull-Rom; higher C's apply sharpening.
  3.) C = 1.0/3.0 is the Mitchell-Netravali filter.
  4.) C = 0.0 is a soft spline filter.
  Standard deviation for Gaussian antialiasing: Try 0.5/aa_pixel_diameter.
  PHOSPHOR MASK:
  Mask type: 0 = aperture grille, 1 = slot mask, 2 = EDP shadow mask
  We can sample the mask three ways.  Pick 2/3 from: Pretty/Fast/Flexible.
  0.) Sinc-resize to the desired dot pitch manually (pretty/slow/flexible).
      This requires PHOSPHOR_MASK_MANUALLY_RESIZE to be #defined.
  1.) Hardware-resize to the desired dot pitch (ugly/fast/flexible).  This
      is halfway decent with LUT mipmapping but atrocious without it.
  2.) Tile it without resizing at a 1:1 texel:pixel ratio for flat coords
      (pretty/fast/inflexible).  Each input LUT has a fixed dot pitch.
      This mode reuses the same masks, so triads will be enormous unless
      you change the mask LUT filenames in your .cgp file.
  Prefer setting the triad size (0.0) or number on the screen (1.0)?
  If RUNTIME_PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_SIGMA isn't #defined, the specified triad size
  will always be used to calculate the full bloom sigma statically.
  Specify the phosphor triad size, in pixels.  Each tile (usually with 8
  triads) will be rounded to the nearest integer tile size and clamped to
  obey minimum size constraints (imposed to reduce downsize taps) and
  maximum size constraints (imposed to have a sane MASK_RESIZE FBO size).
  To increase the size limit, double the viewport-relative scales for the
  two MASK_RESIZE passes in crt-royale.cgp and user-cgp-contants.h.
      range [1, mask_texture_small_size/mask_triads_per_tile]
  If mask_specify_num_triads is 1.0/true, we'll go by this instead (the
  final size will be rounded and constrained as above); default 480.0
  How many lobes should the sinc/Lanczos resizer use?  More lobes require
  more samples and avoid moire a bit better, but some is unavoidable
  depending on the destination size (static option for now).
  The mask is resized using a variable number of taps in each dimension,
  but some Cg profiles always fetch a constant number of taps no matter
  what (no dynamic branching).  We can limit the maximum number of taps if
  we statically limit the minimum phosphor triad size.  Larger values are
  faster, but the limit IS enforced (static option only, forever);
      range [1, mask_texture_small_size/mask_triads_per_tile]
  TODO: Make this 1.0 and compensate with smarter sampling!
  GEOMETRY:
  Geometry mode:
  0: Off (default), 1: Spherical mapping (like cgwg's),
  2: Alt. spherical mapping (more bulbous), 3: Cylindrical/Trinitron
  Radius of curvature: Measured in units of your viewport's diagonal size.
  View dist is the distance from the player to their physical screen, in
  units of the viewport's diagonal size.  It controls the field of view.
  Tilt angle in radians (clockwise around up and right vectors):
  Aspect ratio: When the true viewport size is unknown, this value is used
  to help convert between the phosphor triad size and count, along with
  the mask_resize_viewport_scale constant from user-cgp-constants.h.  Set
  this equal to Retroarch's display aspect ratio (DAR) for best results;
  range [1, geom_max_aspect_ratio from user-cgp-constants.h];
  default (256/224)*(54/47) = 1.313069909 (see below)
  Before getting into overscan, here's some general aspect ratio info:
  - DAR = display aspect ratio = SAR * PAR; as in your Retroarch setting
  - SAR = storage aspect ratio = DAR / PAR; square pixel emulator frame AR
  - PAR = pixel aspect ratio   = DAR / SAR; holds regardless of cropping
  Geometry processing has to "undo" the screen-space 2D DAR to calculate
  3D view vectors, then reapplies the aspect ratio to the simulated CRT in
  uv-space.  To ensure the source SAR is intended for a ~4:3 DAR, either:
  a.) Enable Retroarch's "Crop Overscan
  b.) Readd horizontal padding: Set overscan to e.g. N*(1.0, 240.0/224.0)
  Real consoles use horizontal black padding in the signal, but emulators
  often crop this without cropping the vertical padding; a 256x224 [S]NES
  frame (8:7 SAR) is intended for a ~4:3 DAR, but a 256x240 frame is not.
  The correct [S]NES PAR is 54:47, found by blargg and NewRisingSun:
      http://board.zsnes.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=11928&start=50
      http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=24815#p24815
  For flat output, it's okay to set DAR = [existing] SAR * [correct] PAR
  without doing a. or b., but horizontal image borders will be tighter
  than vertical ones, messing up curvature and overscan.  Fixing the
  padding first corrects this.
  Overscan: Amount to "zoom in" before cropping.  You can zoom uniformly
  or adjust x/y independently to e.g. readd horizontal padding, as noted
  above: Values < 1.0 zoom out; range (0, inf)
  Compute a proper pixel-space to texture-space matrix even without ddx()/
  ddy()?  This is ~8.5% slower but improves antialiasing/subpixel filtering
  with strong curvature (static option only for now).
  BORDERS:
  Rounded border size in texture uv coords:
  Border darkness: Moderate values darken the border smoothly, and high
  values make the image very dark just inside the border:
  Border compression: High numbers compress border transitions, narrowing
  the dark border area.

///////////////////////////////  DESCRIPTION  ////////////////////////////////
  These macros and constants can be used across the whole codebase.
  Unlike the values in user-settings.cgh, end users shouldn't modify these.
////////////////////////////////  INCLUDES  //////////////////////////////////
///////////////////////////  DRIVER CAPABILITIES  ////////////////////////////
  The Cg compiler uses different "profiles" with different capabilities.
  This shader requires a Cg compilation profile >= arbfp1, but a few options
  require higher profiles like fp30 or fp40.  The shader can't detect profile
  or driver capabilities, so instead you must comment or uncomment the lines
  below with "//" before "#define."  Disable an option if you get compilation
  errors resembling those listed.  Generally speaking, all of these options
  will run on nVidia cards, but only DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DBIAS (if that) is
  likely to run on ATI/AMD, due to the Cg compiler's profile limitations.
  Derivatives: Unsupported on fp20, ps_1_1, ps_1_2, ps_1_3, and arbfp1.
  Among other things, derivatives help us fix anisotropic filtering artifacts
  with curved manually tiled phosphor mask coords.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float2 ddx(float2);" not supported in this profile
  error C3004: function "float2 ddy(float2);" not supported in this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_DERIVATIVES
  Fine derivatives: Unsupported on older ATI cards.
  Fine derivatives enable 2x2 fragment block communication, letting us perform
  fast single-pass blur operations.  If your card uses coarse derivatives and
  these are enabled, blurs could look broken.  Derivatives are a prerequisite.
  Dynamic looping: Requires an fp30 or newer profile.
  This makes phosphor mask resampling faster in some cases.  Related errors:
  error C5013: profile does not support "for" statements and "for" could not
  be unrolled
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_BRANCHES
  Without DRIVERS_ALLOW_DYNAMIC_BRANCHES, we need to use unrollable loops.
  Using one static loop avoids overhead if the user is right, but if the user
  is wrong (loops are allowed), breaking a loop into if-blocked pieces with a
  binary search can potentially save some iterations.  However, it may fail:
  error C6001: Temporary register limit of 32 exceeded; 35 registers
  needed to compile program
#define ACCOMODATE_POSSIBLE_DYNAMIC_LOOPS
  tex2Dlod: Requires an fp40 or newer profile.  This can be used to disable
  anisotropic filtering, thereby fixing related artifacts.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float4 tex2Dlod(sampler2D, float4);" not supported in
  this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DLOD
  tex2Dbias: Requires an fp30 or newer profile.  This can be used to alleviate
  artifacts from anisotropic filtering and mipmapping.  Related errors:
  error C3004: function "float4 tex2Dbias(sampler2D, float4);" not supported
  in this profile
#define DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DBIAS
  Integrated graphics compatibility: Integrated graphics like Intel HD 4000
  impose stricter limitations on register counts and instructions.  Enable
  INTEGRATED_GRAPHICS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE if you still see error C6001 or:
  error C6002: Instruction limit of 1024 exceeded: 1523 instructions needed
  to compile program.
  Enabling integrated graphics compatibility mode will automatically disable:
  1.) PHOSPHOR_MASK_MANUALLY_RESIZE: The phosphor mask will be softer.
      (This may be reenabled in a later release.)
  2.) RUNTIME_GEOMETRY_MODE
  3.) The high-quality 4x4 Gaussian resize for the bloom approximation
#define INTEGRATED_GRAPHICS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE
//////////////////////////  USER CODEPATH OPTIONS  ///////////////////////////
  To disable a #define option, turn its line into a comment with "//.
  RUNTIME VS. COMPILE-TIME OPTIONS (Major Performance Implications):
  Enable runtime shader parameters in the Retroarch (etc.) GUI?  They override
  many of the options in this file and allow real-time tuning, but many of
  them are slower.  Disabling them and using this text file will boost FPS.
  Specify the phosphor bloom sigma at runtime?  This option is 10% slower, but
  it's the only way to do a wide-enough full bloom with a runtime dot pitch.
  Specify antialiasing weight parameters at runtime?  (Costs ~20% with cubics)
  Specify subpixel offsets at runtime? (WARNING: EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE!)
#define RUNTIME_ANTIALIAS_SUBPIXEL_OFFSETS
  Make beam_horiz_filter and beam_horiz_linear_rgb_weight into runtime shader
  parameters?  This will require more math or dynamic branching.
  Specify the tilt at runtime?  This makes things about 3% slower.
  Specify the geometry mode at runtime?
  Specify the phosphor mask type (aperture grille, slot mask, shadow mask) and
  mode (Lanczos-resize, hardware resize, or tile 1:1) at runtime, even without
  dynamic branches?  This is cheap if mask_resize_viewport_scale is small.
  PHOSPHOR MASK:
  Manually resize the phosphor mask for best results (slower)?  Disabling this
  removes the option to do so, but it may be faster without dynamic branches.
  If we sinc-resize the mask, should we Lanczos-window it (slower but better)?
  Larger blurs are expensive, but we need them to blur larger triads.  We can
  detect the right blur if the triad size is static or our profile allows
  dynamic branches, but otherwise we use the largest blur the user indicates
  they might need:
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_6_PIXELS
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_9_PIXELS
#define PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_TRIADS_LARGER_THAN_12_PIXELS
  Here's a helpful chart:
  MaxTriadSize    BlurSize    MinTriadCountsByResolution
  3.0             9.0         480/640/960/1920 triads at 1080p/1440p/2160p/4320p, 4:3 aspect

/////////////////////////////  USER PARAMETERS  //////////////////////////////
  Note: Many of these static parameters are overridden by runtime shader
  parameters when those are enabled.  However, many others are static codepath
  options that were cleaner or more convert to code as static constants.
  GAMMA:
  LEVELS MANAGEMENT:
  Control the final multiplicative image contrast:
  We auto-dim to avoid clipping between passes and restore brightness
  later.  Control the dim factor here: Lower values clip less but crush
  blacks more (static only for now).
  HALATION/DIFFUSION/BLOOM:
  Halation weight: How much energy should be lost to electrons bounding
  around under the CRT glass and exciting random phosphors?
  Refractive diffusion weight: How much light should spread/diffuse from
  refracting through the CRT glass?
  Underestimate brightness: Bright areas bloom more, but we can base the
  bloom brightpass on a lower brightness to sharpen phosphors, or a higher
  brightness to soften them.  Low values clip, but >= 0.8 looks okay.
  Blur all colors more than necessary for a softer phosphor bloom?
  The BLOOM_APPROX pass approximates a phosphor blur early on with a small
  blurred resize of the input (convergence offsets are applied as well).
  There are three filter options (static option only for now):
  0.) Bilinear resize: A fast, close approximation to a 4x4 resize
      if min_allowed_viewport_triads and the BLOOM_APPROX resolution are sane
      and beam_max_sigma is low.
  1.) 3x3 resize blur: Medium speed, soft/smeared from bilinear blurring,
      always uses a static sigma regardless of beam_max_sigma or
      mask_num_triads_desired.
  2.) True 4x4 Gaussian resize: Slowest, technically correct.
  These options are more pronounced for the fast, unbloomed shader version.
  ELECTRON BEAM SCANLINE DISTRIBUTION:
  How many scanlines should contribute light to each pixel?  Using more
  scanlines is slower (especially for a generalized Gaussian) but less
  distorted with larger beam sigmas (especially for a pure Gaussian).  The
  max_beam_sigma at which the closest unused weight is guaranteed <
  1.0/255.0 (for a 3x antialiased pure Gaussian) is:
      2 scanlines: max_beam_sigma = 0.2089; distortions begin ~0.34; 141.7 FPS pure, 131.9 FPS generalized
      3 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.3879; distortions begin ~0.52; 137.5 FPS pure; 123.8 FPS generalized
      4 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.5723; distortions begin ~0.70; 134.7 FPS pure; 117.2 FPS generalized
      5 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.7591; distortions begin ~0.89; 131.6 FPS pure; 112.1 FPS generalized
      6 scanlines, max_beam_sigma = 0.9483; distortions begin ~1.08; 127.9 FPS pure; 105.6 FPS generalized
  A generalized Gaussian beam varies shape with color too, now just width.
  It's slower but more flexible (static option only for now).
  What kind of scanline antialiasing do you want?
  0: Sample weights at 1x; 1: Sample weights at 3x; 2: Compute an integral
  Integrals are slow (especially for generalized Gaussians) and rarely any
  better than 3x antialiasing (static option only for now).
  Min/max standard deviations for scanline beams: Higher values widen and
  soften scanlines.  Depending on other options, low min sigmas can alias.
  Beam width varies as a function of color: A power function (0) is more
  configurable, but a spherical function (1) gives the widest beam
  variability without aliasing (static option only for now).
  Spot shape power: Powers <= 1 give smoother spot shapes but lower
  sharpness.  Powers >= 1.0 are awful unless mix/max sigmas are close.
  Generalized Gaussian max shape parameters: Higher values give flatter
  scanline plateaus and steeper dropoffs, simultaneously widening and
  sharpening scanlines at the cost of aliasing.  2.0 is pure Gaussian, and
  values > ~40.0 cause artifacts with integrals.
  Generalized Gaussian shape power: Affects how quickly the distribution
  changes shape from Gaussian to steep/plateaued as color increases from 0
  to 1.0.  Higher powers appear softer for most colors, and lower powers
  appear sharper for most colors.
  What filter should be used to sample scanlines horizontally?
  0: Quilez (fast), 1: Gaussian (configurable), 2: Lanczos2 (sharp)
  Standard deviation for horizontal Gaussian resampling:
  Do horizontal scanline sampling in linear RGB (correct light mixing),
  gamma-encoded RGB (darker, hard spot shape, may better match bandwidth-
  limiting circuitry in some CRT's), or a weighted avg.?
  Simulate scanline misconvergence?  This needs 3x horizontal texture
  samples and 3x texture samples of BLOOM_APPROX and HALATION_BLUR in
  later passes (static option only for now).
  Convergence offsets in x/y directions for R/G/B scanline beams in units
  of scanlines.  Positive offsets go right/down; ranges [-2, 2]
  Detect interlacing (static option only for now)?
  Assume 1080-line sources are interlaced?
  For interlaced sources, assume TFF (top-field first) or BFF order?
  (Whether this matters depends on the nature of the interlaced input.)
  ANTIALIASING:
  What AA level do you want for curvature/overscan/subpixels?  Options:
  0x (none), 1x (sample subpixels), 4x, 5x, 6x, 7x, 8x, 12x, 16x, 20x, 24x
  (Static option only for now)
  What antialiasing filter do you want (static option only)?  Options:
  0: Box (separable), 1: Box (cylindrical),
  2: Tent (separable), 3: Tent (cylindrical),
  4: Gaussian (separable), 5: Gaussian (cylindrical),
  6: Cubic* (separable), 7: Cubic* (cylindrical, poor)
  8: Lanczos Sinc (separable), 9: Lanczos Jinc (cylindrical, poor)
      * = Especially slow with RUNTIME_ANTIALIAS_WEIGHTS
  Flip the sample grid on odd/even frames (static option only for now)?
  Use RGB subpixel offsets for antialiasing?  The pixel is at green, and
  the blue offset is the negative r offset; range [0, 0.5]
  Cubics: See http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/filter/#mitchell
  1.) "Keys cubics" with B = 1 - 2C are considered the highest quality.
  2.) C = 0.5 (default) is Catmull-Rom; higher C's apply sharpening.
  3.) C = 1.0/3.0 is the Mitchell-Netravali filter.
  4.) C = 0.0 is a soft spline filter.
  Standard deviation for Gaussian antialiasing: Try 0.5/aa_pixel_diameter.
  PHOSPHOR MASK:
  Mask type: 0 = aperture grille, 1 = slot mask, 2 = EDP shadow mask
  We can sample the mask three ways.  Pick 2/3 from: Pretty/Fast/Flexible.
  0.) Sinc-resize to the desired dot pitch manually (pretty/slow/flexible).
      This requires PHOSPHOR_MASK_MANUALLY_RESIZE to be #defined.
  1.) Hardware-resize to the desired dot pitch (ugly/fast/flexible).  This
      is halfway decent with LUT mipmapping but atrocious without it.
  2.) Tile it without resizing at a 1:1 texel:pixel ratio for flat coords
      (pretty/fast/inflexible).  Each input LUT has a fixed dot pitch.
      This mode reuses the same masks, so triads will be enormous unless
      you change the mask LUT filenames in your .cgp file.
  Prefer setting the triad size (0.0) or number on the screen (1.0)?
  If RUNTIME_PHOSPHOR_BLOOM_SIGMA isn't #defined, the specified triad size
  will always be used to calculate the full bloom sigma statically.
  Specify the phosphor triad size, in pixels.  Each tile (usually with 8
  triads) will be rounded to the nearest integer tile size and clamped to
  obey minimum size constraints (imposed to reduce downsize taps) and
  maximum size constraints (imposed to have a sane MASK_RESIZE FBO size).
  To increase the size limit, double the viewport-relative scales for the
  two MASK_RESIZE passes in crt-royale.cgp and user-cgp-contants.h.
      range [1, mask_texture_small_size/mask_triads_per_tile]
  If mask_specify_num_triads is 1.0/true, we'll go by this instead (the
  final size will be rounded and constrained as above); default 480.0
  How many lobes should the sinc/Lanczos resizer use?  More lobes require
  more samples and avoid moire a bit better, but some is unavoidable
  depending on the destination size (static option for now).
  The mask is resized using a variable number of taps in each dimension,
  but some Cg profiles always fetch a constant number of taps no matter
  what (no dynamic branching).  We can limit the maximum number of taps if
  we statically limit the minimum phosphor triad size.  Larger values are
  faster, but the limit IS enforced (static option only, forever);
      range [1, mask_texture_small_size/mask_triads_per_tile]
  TODO: Make this 1.0 and compensate with smarter sampling!
  GEOMETRY:
  Geometry mode:
  0: Off (default), 1: Spherical mapping (like cgwg's),
  2: Alt. spherical mapping (more bulbous), 3: Cylindrical/Trinitron
  Radius of curvature: Measured in units of your viewport's diagonal size.
  View dist is the distance from the player to their physical screen, in
  units of the viewport's diagonal size.  It controls the field of view.
  Tilt angle in radians (clockwise around up and right vectors):
  Aspect ratio: When the true viewport size is unknown, this value is used
  to help convert between the phosphor triad size and count, along with
  the mask_resize_viewport_scale constant from user-cgp-constants.h.  Set
  this equal to Retroarch's display aspect ratio (DAR) for best results;
  range [1, geom_max_aspect_ratio from user-cgp-constants.h];
  default (256/224)*(54/47) = 1.313069909 (see below)
  Before getting into overscan, here's some general aspect ratio info:
  - DAR = display aspect ratio = SAR * PAR; as in your Retroarch setting
  - SAR = storage aspect ratio = DAR / PAR; square pixel emulator frame AR
  - PAR = pixel aspect ratio   = DAR / SAR; holds regardless of cropping
  Geometry processing has to "undo" the screen-space 2D DAR to calculate
  3D view vectors, then reapplies the aspect ratio to the simulated CRT in
  uv-space.  To ensure the source SAR is intended for a ~4:3 DAR, either:
  a.) Enable Retroarch's "Crop Overscan
  b.) Readd horizontal padding: Set overscan to e.g. N*(1.0, 240.0/224.0)
  Real consoles use horizontal black padding in the signal, but emulators
  often crop this without cropping the vertical padding; a 256x224 [S]NES
  frame (8:7 SAR) is intended for a ~4:3 DAR, but a 256x240 frame is not.
  The correct [S]NES PAR is 54:47, found by blargg and NewRisingSun:
      http://board.zsnes.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=11928&start=50
      http://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?p=24815#p24815
  For flat output, it's okay to set DAR = [existing] SAR * [correct] PAR
  without doing a. or b., but horizontal image borders will be tighter
  than vertical ones, messing up curvature and overscan.  Fixing the
  padding first corrects this.
  Overscan: Amount to "zoom in" before cropping.  You can zoom uniformly
  or adjust x/y independently to e.g. readd horizontal padding, as noted
  above: Values < 1.0 zoom out; range (0, inf)
  Compute a proper pixel-space to texture-space matrix even without ddx()/
  ddy()?  This is ~8.5% slower but improves antialiasing/subpixel filtering
  with strong curvature (static option only for now).
  BORDERS:
  Rounded border size in texture uv coords:
  Border darkness: Moderate values darken the border smoothly, and high
  values make the image very dark just inside the border:
  Border compression: High numbers compress border transitions, narrowing
  the dark border area.
  IMPORTANT:
  These constants MUST be set appropriately for the settings in crt-royale.cgp
  (or whatever related .cgp file you're using).  If they aren't, you're likely
  to get artifacts, the wrong phosphor mask size, etc.  I wish these could be
  set directly in the .cgp file to make things easier, but...they can't.
  PASS SCALES AND RELATED CONSTANTS:
  Copy the absolute scale_x for BLOOM_APPROX.  There are two major versions of
  this shader: One does a viewport-scale bloom, and the other skips it.  The
  latter benefits from a higher bloom_approx_scale_x, so save both separately:
  Copy the viewport-relative scales of the phosphor mask resize passes
  (MASK_RESIZE and the pass immediately preceding it):
  Copy the geom_max_aspect_ratio used to calculate the MASK_RESIZE scales, etc.:
  PHOSPHOR MASK TEXTURE CONSTANTS:
  Set the following constants to reflect the properties of the phosphor mask
  texture named in crt-royale.cgp.  The shader optionally resizes a mask tile
  based on user settings, then repeats a single tile until filling the screen.
  The shader must know the input texture size (default 64x64), and to manually
  resize, it must also know the horizontal triads per tile (default 8).
  We need the average brightness of the phosphor mask to compensate for the
  dimming it causes.  The following four values are roughly correct for the
  masks included with the shader.  Update the value for any LUT texture you
  change.  [Un]comment "#define PHOSPHOR_MASK_GRILLE14" depending on whether
  the loaded aperture grille uses 14-pixel or 15-pixel stripes (default 15).
#define PHOSPHOR_MASK_GRILLE14

/////////////////////////////  FIXED SETTINGS  ///////////////////////////////
  Avoid dividing by zero; using a macro overloads for float, float2, etc.:
  Ensure the first pass decodes CRT gamma and the last encodes LCD gamma.
  Manually tiling a manually resized texture creates texture coord derivative
  discontinuities and confuses anisotropic filtering, causing discolored tile
  seams in the phosphor mask.  Workarounds:
  a.) Using tex2Dlod disables anisotropic filtering for tiled masks.  It's
      downgraded to tex2Dbias without DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DLOD #defined and
      disabled without DRIVERS_ALLOW_TEX2DBIAS #defined either.
  b.) "Tile flat twice" requires drawing two full tiles without border padding
      to the resized mask FBO, and it's incompatible with same-pass curvature.
      (Same-pass curvature isn't used but could be in the future...maybe.)
  c.) "Fix discontinuities" requires derivatives and drawing one tile with
      border padding to the resized mask FBO, but it works with same-pass
      curvature.  It's disabled without DRIVERS_ALLOW_DERIVATIVES #defined.
  Precedence: a, then, b, then c (if multiple strategies are #defined).
  Also, manually resampling the phosphor mask is slightly blurrier with
  anisotropic filtering.  (Resampling with mipmapping is even worse: It
  creates artifacts, but only with the fully bloomed shader.)  The difference
  is subtle with small triads, but you can fix it for a small cost.
#define ANISOTROPIC_RESAMPLING_COMPAT_TEX2DLOD
////////////////////////////  DERIVED SETTINGS  //////////////////////////////
  Intel HD 4000 GPU's can't handle manual mask resizing (for now), setting the
  geometry mode at runtime, or a 4x4 true Gaussian resize.  Disable
  incompatible settings ASAP.  (INTEGRATED_GRAPHICS_COMPATIBILITY_MODE may be
  #defined by either user-settings.h or a wrapper .cg that #includes the
  current .cg pass.)
  Mode 2 (4x4 Gaussian resize) won't work, and mode 1 (3x3 blur) is
  inferior in most cases, so replace 2.0 with 0.0:
  Disable slow runtime paths if static parameters are used.  Most of these
  won't be a problem anyway once the params are disabled, but some will.
  Make tex2Dbias a backup for tex2Dlod for wider compatibility.
  Rule out unavailable anisotropic compatibility strategies:
  Prioritize anisotropic tiling compatibility strategies by performance and
  disable unused strategies.  This concentrates all the nesting in one place.
  ANISOTROPIC_TILING_COMPAT_TILE_FLAT_TWICE is only compatible with
  flat texture coords in the same pass, but that's all we use.
  The tex2Dlod and tex2Dbias strategies share a lot in common, and we can
  reduce some #ifdef nesting in the next section by essentially OR'ing them:
  Prioritize anisotropic resampling compatibility strategies the same way:
/////////////////////  DERIVED PHOSPHOR MASK CONSTANTS  //////////////////////
  If we can use the large mipmapped LUT without mipmapping artifacts, we
  should: It gives us more options for using fewer samples.
  TODO: Take advantage of this!
  tex2D's sampler2D parameter MUST be a uniform global, a uniform input to
  main_fragment, or a static alias of one of the above.  This makes it hard
  to select the phosphor mask at runtime: We can't even assign to a uniform
  global in the vertex shader or select a sampler2D in the vertex shader and
  pass it to the fragment shader (even with explicit TEXUNIT# bindings),
  because it just gives us the input texture or a black screen.  However, we
  can get around these limitations by calling tex2D three times with different
  uniform samplers (or resizing the phosphor mask three times altogether).
  With dynamic branches, we can process only one of these branches on top of
  quickly discarding fragments we don't need (cgc seems able to overcome
  limigations around dependent texture fetches inside of branches).  Without
  dynamic branches, we have to process every branch for every fragment...which
  is slower.  Runtime sampling mode selection is slower without dynamic
  branches as well.  Let the user's static #defines decide if it's worth it.
  We need to render some minimum number of tiles in the resize passes.
  We need at least 1.0 just to repeat a single tile, and we need extra
  padding beyond that for anisotropic filtering, discontinuitity fixing,
  antialiasing, same-pass curvature (not currently used), etc.  First
  determine how many border texels and tiles we need, based on how the result
  will be sampled:
  Most antialiasing filters have a base radius of 4.0 pixels:
  Anisotropic filtering adds about 0.5 to the pixel border:
  Fixing discontinuities adds 1.0 more to the pixel border:
  Convert the pixel border to an integer texel border.  Assume same-pass
  curvature about triples the texel frequency:
  Convert the texel border to a tile border using worst-case assumptions:
  Finally, set the number of resized tiles to render to MASK_RESIZE, and set
  the starting texel (inside borders) for sampling it.
  Special case: Render two tiles without borders.  Anisotropic
  filtering doesn't seem to be a problem here.
  We have to fit mask_resize_num_tiles into an FBO with a viewport scale of
  mask_resize_viewport_scale.  This limits the maximum final triad size.
  Estimate the minimum number of triads we can split the screen into in each
  dimension (we'll be as correct as mask_resize_viewport_scale is):
//////////////////////  COMMON MATHEMATICAL CONSTANTS  ///////////////////////
  We often want to find the location of the previous texel, e.g.:
      const float2 curr_texel = uv * texture_size;
      const float2 prev_texel = floor(curr_texel - float2(0.5)) + float2(0.5);
      const float2 prev_texel_uv = prev_texel / texture_size;
  However, many GPU drivers round incorrectly around exact texel locations.
  We need to subtract a little less than 0.5 before flooring, and some GPU's
  require this value to be farther from 0.5 than others; define it here.
      const float2 prev_texel =
          floor(curr_texel - float2(under_half)) + float2(0.5);
  Override some parameters for gamma-management.h and tex2Dantialias.h:
  Disable runtime shader params if the user doesn't explicitly want them.
  Static constants will be defined in place of uniforms of the same name.
  Bind option names to shader parameter uniforms or static constants.
  Use constants from user-settings.h, and limit ranges appropriately:
  Unpack static vector elements to match scalar uniforms:
#define interlace_bff global.interlace_bff
  Provide accessors for vector constants that pack scalar uniforms:
  Get an aspect ratio vector.  Enforce geom_max_aspect_ratio, and prevent
  the absolute scale from affecting the uv-mapping for curvature:
  WARNING: THIS IS EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.
  Provide accessors settings which still need "cooking:

              3.) b_over_2 must be guaranteed < 0.0 (avoids a branch)
  Returns:    Returns float2(first_solution, discriminant), so the caller
              can choose how to handle the "no intersection" case.  The
              Kahan or Citardauq formula is used for numerical robustness.
  Requires:   1.) view_vec and eye_pos_vec are 3D vectors in the sphere's

                  a vector from the origin to the eye/camera)
              2.) geom_radius is a global containing the sphere's radius

  Quadratic formula coefficients (b_over_2 is guaranteed negative):
  Requires:   1.) view_vec and eye_pos_vec are 3D vectors in the sphere's
                  local coordinate frame (eye_pos_vec is a position, i.e.
                  a vector from the origin to the eye/camera)
              2.) geom_radius is a global containing the cylinder's radius
  Returns:    Cast a ray of direction view_vec from eye_pos_vec at a
              cylinder of radius geom_radius, and return the distance to
              the first intersection in units of length(view_vec).  The
              derivation of the coefficients is in Christer Ericson's
              Real-Time Collision Detection, p. 195-196, and this version
              uses LaGrange's identity to reduce operations.
  Arbitrary "cylinder top" reference point for an infinite cylinder:
  Quadratic formula coefficients (b_over_2 is guaranteed negative):
  Requires:   An xyz intersection position on a cylinder.
  Returns:    video_uv coords mapped to range [-0.5, 0.5]
  Mapping:    Define square_uv.x to be the signed arc length in xz-space,
              and define square_uv.y = -intersection_pos_local.y (+v = -y).
  Start with a numerically robust arc length calculation.
  Get a uv-mapping where [-0.5, 0.5] maps to a "square" area, then divide
  by the aspect ratio to stretch the mapping appropriately:
  Requires:   video_uv coords mapped to range [-0.5, 0.5]
  Returns:    An xyz intersection position on a cylinder.  This is the
              inverse of cylinder_xyz_to_uv().
  Expand video_uv by the aspect ratio to get proportionate x/y lengths,
  then calculate an xyz position for the cylindrical mapping above.
  Or: z = sqrt(geom_radius**2 - x**2)
  Or: z = geom_radius/sqrt(1.0 + tan(angle)**2), x = z * tan(angle)
  Requires:   An xyz intersection position on a sphere.
  Returns:    video_uv coords mapped to range [-0.5, 0.5]
  Mapping:    First define square_uv.x/square_uv.y ==
              intersection_pos_local.x/intersection_pos_local.y.  Then,
              length(square_uv) is the arc length from the image center
              at (0.0, 0.0, geom_radius) along the tangent great circle.
              Credit for this mapping goes to cgwg: I never managed to
              understand his code, but he told me his mapping was based on
              great circle distances when I asked him about it, which
              informed this very similar (almost identical) mapping.
  Start with a numerically robust arc length calculation between the ray-
  sphere intersection point and the image center using a method posted by
  Roger Stafford on comp.soft-sys.matlab:

  Get a uv-mapping where [-0.5, 0.5] maps to a "square" area, then divide
  by the aspect ratio to stretch the mapping appropriately:
  Requires:   video_uv coords mapped to range [-0.5, 0.5]
  Returns:    An xyz intersection position on a sphere.  This is the
              inverse of sphere_xyz_to_uv().
  Expand video_uv by the aspect ratio to get proportionate x/y lengths,
  then calculate an xyz position for the spherical mapping above.
  Using length or sqrt here butchers the framerate on my 8800GTS if
  this function is called too many times, and so does taking the max
  component of square_uv/square_uv_unit (program length threshold?).
float arc_len = length(square_uv);
float2 xy_pos = xy_dist_from_sphere_center * (square_uv/FIX_ZERO(arc_len));
  Requires:   An xyz intersection position on a cylinder.
  Returns:    video_uv coords mapped to range [-0.5, 0.5]
  Mapping:    Define square_uv.x to be the signed arc length in xz-space,
              and define square_uv.y == signed arc length in yz-space.
  See cylinder_xyz_to_uv() for implementation details (very similar).
  Requires:   video_uv coords mapped to range [-0.5, 0.5]
  Returns:    An xyz intersection position on a sphere.  This is the
              inverse of sphere_alt_xyz_to_uv().
  See cylinder_uv_to_xyz() for implementation details (very similar).
  Get the intersection point on the primitive, given an eye position
  and view vector already in its local coordinate frame:
  Save the intersection position to an output parameter:
  Transform into uv coords, but give out-of-range coords if the
  view ray doesn't intersect the primitive in the first place:
  Requires:   Parameters:
              1.) Starting eye_pos is a global 3D position at which the
                  camera contains all points in global_coords[] in its FOV
              2.) geom_aspect = get_aspect_vector(
                      IN.output_size.x / IN.output_size.y);
              3.) global_coords is a point cloud containing global xyz
                  coords of extreme points on the simulated CRT screen.
              Globals:
              1.) geom_view_dist must be > 0.0.  It controls the "near
                  plane" used to interpret flat_video_uv as a view
                  vector, which controls the field of view (FOV).
              Eyespace coordinate frame: +x = right, +y = up, +z = back
  Returns:    Return an eye position at which the point cloud spans as
              much of the screen as possible (given the FOV controlled by
              geom_view_dist) without being cropped or sheared.
  Algorithm:
  1.) Move the eye laterally to a point which attempts to maximize the
      the amount we can move forward without clipping the CRT screen.
  2.) Move forward by as much as possible without clipping the CRT.
  Get the allowed movement range by solving for the eye_pos offsets
  that result in each point being projected to a screen edge/corner in
  pseudo-normalized device coords (where xy ranges from [-0.5, 0.5]
  and z = eyespace z):
      pndc_coord = float3(float2(eyespace_xyz.x, -eyespace_xyz.y)*
      geom_view_dist / (geom_aspect * -eyespace_xyz.z), eyespace_xyz.z);
  Notes:
  The field of view is controlled by geom_view_dist's magnitude relative to
  the view vector's x and y components:
      view_vec.xy ranges from [-0.5, 0.5] * geom_aspect
      view_vec.z = -geom_view_dist
  But for the purposes of perspective divide, it should be considered:
      view_vec.xy ranges from [-0.5, 0.5] * geom_aspect / geom_view_dist
      view_vec.z = -1.0
  0.) Get the eyespace coordinates of our point cloud:
  1a.)For each point, find out how far we can move eye_pos in each
      lateral direction without the point clipping the frustum.
      Eyespace +y = up, screenspace +y = down, so flip y after
      applying the eyespace offset (on the way to "clip space").
  Solve for two offsets per point based on:
      (eyespace_xyz.xy - offset_dr) * float2(1.0, -1.0) *
      geom_view_dist / (geom_aspect * -eyespace_xyz.z) = float2(-0.5)
      (eyespace_xyz.xy - offset_dr) * float2(1.0, -1.0) *
      geom_view_dist / (geom_aspect * -eyespace_xyz.z) = float2(0.5)
  offset_ul and offset_dr represent the farthest we can move the
  eye_pos up-left and down-right.  Save the min of all offset_dr's
  and the max of all offset_ul's (since it's negative).
  1b.)Update eye_pos: Adding the average of offset_ul_max and
      offset_dr_min gives it equal leeway on the top vs. bottom
      and left vs. right.  Recalculate eyespace_coords accordingly.
  2a.)For each point, find out how far we can move eye_pos forward
      without the point clipping the frustum.  Flip the y
      direction in advance (matters for a later step, not here).
      Solve for four offsets per point based on:
      eyespace_xyz_flipy.x * geom_view_dist /
          (geom_aspect.x * (offset_z - eyespace_xyz_flipy.z)) =-0.5
      eyespace_xyz_flipy.y * geom_view_dist /
          (geom_aspect.y * (offset_z - eyespace_xyz_flipy.z)) =-0.5
      eyespace_xyz_flipy.x * geom_view_dist /
          (geom_aspect.x * (offset_z - eyespace_xyz_flipy.z)) = 0.5
      eyespace_xyz_flipy.y * geom_view_dist /
          (geom_aspect.y * (offset_z - eyespace_xyz_flipy.z)) = 0.5
      We'll vectorize the actual computation.  Take the maximum of
      these four for a single offset, and continue taking the max
      for every point (use max because offset.z is negative).
  Ignore offsets that push positive x/y values to opposite
  boundaries, and vice versa, and don't let the camera move
  past a point in the dead center of the screen:
  2b.)Update eye_pos: Add the maximum (smallest negative) z offset.
  Start with an initial eye_pos that includes the entire primitive
  (sphere or cylinder) in its field-of-view:
  Trigonometry/similar triangles say distance = geom_radius/sin(fov/2):
  Get global xyz coords of extreme sample points on the simulated CRT
  screen.  Start with the center, edge centers, and corners of the
  video image.  We can't ignore backfacing points: They're occluded
  by closer points on the primitive, but they may NOT be occluded by
  the convex hull of the remaining samples (i.e. the remaining convex
  hull might not envelope points that do occlude a back-facing point.)
  Adding more inner image points could help in extreme cases, but too many
  points will kille the framerate.  For safety, default to the initial
  eye_pos if any z coords are negative:
  Outsource the optimized eye_pos calculation:
  Requires:   See get_curved_video_uv_coords_and_tangent_matrix for
              descriptions of each parameter.
  Returns:    Return a transformation matrix from 2D pixel-space vectors
              (where (+1.0, +1.0) is a vector to one pixel down-right,
              i.e. same directionality as uv texels) to 3D object-space
              vectors in the CRT's local coordinate frame (right-handed)
              ***which are tangent to the CRT surface at the intersection
              position.***  (Basically, we want to convert pixel-space
              vectors to 3D vectors along the CRT's surface, for later
              conversion to uv vectors.)
  Shorthand inputs:
  Get a piecewise-linear matrix transforming from "pixelspace" offset
  vectors (1.0 = one pixel) to object space vectors in the tangent
  plane (faster than finding 3 view-object intersections).
  1.) Get the local view vecs for the pixels to the right and down:
  2.) Using the true intersection point, intersect the neighboring
      view vectors with the tangent plane:
  3.) Subtract the original intersection pos from its neighbors; the
      resulting vectors are object-space vectors tangent to the plane.
      These vectors are the object-space transformations of (1.0, 0.0)
      and (0.0, 1.0) pixel offsets, so they form the first two basis
      vectors of a pixelspace to object space transformation.  This
      transformation is 2D to 3D, so use (0, 0, 0) for the third vector.
  Requires:   See get_curved_video_uv_coords_and_tangent_matrix for
              descriptions of each parameter.
  Returns:    Return a transformation matrix from 3D object-space vectors
              in the CRT's local coordinate frame (right-handed, +y = up)
              to 2D video_uv vectors (+v = down).
  Description:
  The TBN matrix formed by the [tangent, bitangent, normal] basis
  vectors transforms ordinary vectors from tangent->object space.
  The cotangent matrix formed by the [cotangent, cobitangent, normal]
  basis vectors transforms normal vectors (covectors) from
  tangent->object space.  It's the inverse-transpose of the TBN matrix.
  We want the inverse of the TBN matrix (transpose of the cotangent
  matrix), which transforms ordinary vectors from object->tangent space.
  Start by calculating the relevant basis vectors in accordance with
  Christian Schüler's blog post "Followup: Normal Mapping Without
  Precomputed Tangents":  http://www.thetenthplanet.de/archives/1180
  With our particular uv mapping, the scale of the u and v directions
  is determined entirely by the aspect ratio for cylindrical and ordinary
  spherical mappings, and so tangent and bitangent lengths are also
  determined by it (the alternate mapping is more complex).  Therefore, we
  must ensure appropriate cotangent and cobitangent lengths as well.
  Base these off the uv<=>xyz mappings for each primitive.
  The tangent and bitangent vectors correspond with increasing u and v,
  respectively.  Mathematically we'd base the cotangent/cobitangent on
  those, but we'll compute the cotangent/cobitangent directly when we can.
  geom_mode should be constant-folded without RUNTIME_GEOMETRY_MODE.
  Sphere:
  tangent = normalize(cross(normal, cross(x_vec, pos))) * geom_aspect.x
  bitangent = normalize(cross(cross(y_vec, pos), normal)) * geom_aspect.y
  inv_determinant = 1.0/length(cross(bitangent, tangent))
  cotangent = cross(normal, bitangent) * inv_determinant
            == normalize(cross(y_vec, pos)) * geom_aspect.y * inv_determinant
  cobitangent = cross(tangent, normal) * inv_determinant
            == normalize(cross(x_vec, pos)) * geom_aspect.x * inv_determinant
  Simplified (scale by inv_determinant below):
  Sphere, alternate mapping:
  This mapping works a bit like the cylindrical mapping in two
  directions, which makes the lengths and directions more complex.
  Unfortunately, I can't find much of a shortcut:
  Cylinder:
  tangent = normalize(cross(y_vec, normal)) * geom_aspect.x;
  bitangent = float3(0.0, -geom_aspect.y, 0.0);
  inv_determinant = 1.0/length(cross(bitangent, tangent))
  cotangent = cross(normal, bitangent) * inv_determinant
            == normalize(cross(y_vec, pos)) * geom_aspect.y * inv_determinant
  cobitangent = cross(tangent, normal) * inv_determinant
            == float3(0.0, -geom_aspect.x, 0.0) * inv_determinant
  The [cotangent, cobitangent, normal] column vecs form the cotangent
  frame, i.e. the inverse-transpose TBN matrix.  Get its transpose:
  Requires:   Parameters:
              1.) flat_video_uv coords are in range [0.0, 1.0], where
                  (0.0, 0.0) is the top-left corner of the screen and
                  (1.0, 1.0) is the bottom-right corner.
              2.) eye_pos_local is the 3D camera position in the simulated
                  CRT's local coordinate frame.  For best results, it must
                  be computed based on the same geom_view_dist used here.
              3.) output_size_inv = float2(1.0)/IN.output_size
              4.) geom_aspect = get_aspect_vector(
                      IN.output_size.x / IN.output_size.y);
              5.) geom_mode is a static or runtime mode setting:
                  0 = off, 1 = sphere, 2 = sphere alt., 3 = cylinder
              6.) global_to_local is a 3x3 matrix transforming (ordinary)
                  worldspace vectors to the CRT's local coordinate frame
              Globals:
              1.) geom_view_dist must be > 0.0.  It controls the "near
                  plane" used to interpret flat_video_uv as a view
                  vector, which controls the field of view (FOV).
  Returns:    Return final uv coords in [0.0, 1.0], and return a pixel-
              space to video_uv tangent-space matrix in the out parameter.
              (This matrix assumes pixel-space +y = down, like +v = down.)
              We'll transform flat_video_uv into a view vector, project
              the view vector from the camera/eye, intersect with a sphere
              or cylinder representing the simulated CRT, and convert the
              intersection position into final uv coords and a local
              transformation matrix.
  First get the 3D view vector (geom_aspect and geom_view_dist are globals):
  1.) Center uv around (0.0, 0.0) and make (-0.5, -0.5) and (0.5, 0.5)
      correspond to the top-left/bottom-right output screen corners.
  2.) Multiply by geom_aspect to preemptively "undo" Retroarch's screen-
      space 2D aspect correction.  We'll reapply it in uv-space.
  3.) (x, y) = (u, -v), because +v is down in 2D screenspace, but +y
      is up in 3D worldspace (enforce a right-handed system).
  4.) The view vector z controls the "near plane" distance and FOV.
      For the effect of "looking through a window" at a CRT, it should be
      set equal to the user's distance from their physical screen, in
      units of the viewport's physical diagonal size.
  Transform the view vector into the CRT's local coordinate frame, convert
  to video_uv coords, and get the local 3D intersection position:
  Get a pixel-to-tangent-video-uv matrix.  The caller could deal with
  all but one of these cases, but that would be more complicated.
  Derivatives obtain a matrix very fast, but the direction of pixel-
  space +y seems to depend on the pass.  Enforce the correct direction
  on a best-effort basis (but it shouldn't matter for antialiasing).
  Manually define a transformation matrix.  We'll assume pixel-space
  +y = down, just like +v = down.
  Get the surface normal based on the local intersection position:
  Get pixel-to-object and object-to-tangent matrices and combine
  them into a 2x2 pixel-to-tangent matrix for video_uv offsets:
  Ignore curvature, and just consider flat scaling.  The
  difference is only apparent with strong curvature:
